            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THere have been few Perſons upon whoſe actions ſo many different Sentiments have paſſed, as upon thoſe of <hi>Oliver Cromwel;</hi> ſome advancing his Courage and Reputation to the height, others on the contrary, depreſſing them as low, and not allowing that he had any thing praiſe-worthy in his Conduct, in thoſe great Imployments and Offices, even the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Three Nations which he paſſed through: Yea, they invade the Almighties Province of judging the Hearts and Thoughts of Men, attributing all to Hypocriſie and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, aſſerting that he had Hopes and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations of raiſing himſelf to that Grandeur whereto he after arrived, many years before he attained it; nay, ſo early as when he was but a Collonel, and can hardly be thought to have had the leaſt proſpect thereof. But to leave every Man to his Opinion in this matter, I
<pb facs="tcp:57818:3"/>thought it might not be unacceptable to my Country-men, to give a plain and Impartial Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Matters of Fact performed and acted by him, both in his Military, and afterwards in his Civil Capacity, without Reflections on Parties, which ought to be the care of a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Hiſtorian, if he expects to be believed by Poſterity. It is a Maxim, That great Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues have been often mixed with great Vices in many great men in the World, neither is <hi>Cromwel</hi> excuſed from this Cenſure, who had ſeveral worthy and blameable Qualities in him; but ſince he is out of the reach either of good or bad Report, I ſhall leave him, and refer you to read his Atchievements, which are briefly related in the following Manual.</p>

            <head>THE HISTORY OF Oliver Cromwel.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>OLiver Cromwel</hi> was deſcended of an Ancient Family in <hi>Huntington-ſhire,</hi> who had a very plentiful Eſtate; his Grandfather was Sir <hi>Henry Cromwel,</hi> a Perſon of good Reputation, and had iſſue five Sons, Sir <hi>Oliver</hi> his Eldeſt, <hi>Henry, Robert, Richard</hi> and <hi>Philip.</hi> This our <hi>Oliver Cromwel</hi> was Son of the third Brother <hi>Richard,</hi> who was likewiſe in much eſteem in his Country, and Married <hi>Elizabeth Steward,</hi> Peace of Sir <hi>Robert Steward,</hi> a Gentleman of a conſiderable Eſtate in that Country, by whom he had this <hi>Oliver,</hi> who was born in the Town of <hi>Huntington, April</hi> 25. 1599. and had his Name given him by his Uncle Sir <hi>Oliver.</hi> When he was a Child, he ſeemed to delight in Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Exerciſes, and by the care of his Father was ſent to the Free School of that Town, and afterward to <hi>Sydney</hi>-Colledge in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> where while he was
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57818:4"/>a Student, there were ſeveral Omens of his future Grandeur, and he was obſerved more to be enclined to the Military than Contemplative Life: During his continuance here his Father died, upon which he returned home, and ſpent hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> time in the Youthful Follies and Extravagancies incident to perſons of his age and temper, whereupon his Mother, by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of her Friends, ſent him up to <hi>London,</hi> and placed him in <hi>Lincolns-Inn,</hi> thereby to qualifie him for a Gentleman, and to put him into a Capacity to be ſerviceable to his Country.</p>
            <p>Having continued here for ſome time, and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to confine himſelf to this Sedentary Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he again returns into the Country, and there proceeds in the ſame lewd courſes as before, but as he grew in years he became more ſolid and conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, inſomuch that in a while he was as remarkable for his Sobriety, as before for his Rudene<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, which ſo much pleaſed and obliged his Uncle Sir <hi>Robert Steward,</hi> that he left him his Heir to a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fine Eſtate of four or five hundred pounds a year. But before this came into his hands by the Death of his Uncle, the reputation of it, and the remarkable alteration in his diſpoſition, recommended him to <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> the Daughter of Sir <hi>James Boucher,</hi> whom he Married, and though at firſt, when this notable reformation was perceived in him, he adhered to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> frequenting the moſt famous Preachers with much ſeeming warmth and zeal, yet afterwards, when thoſe called Puritans grew popular, he began to have a good opinion of them, inviting the Miniſters to his Houſe, and entertaining them with much kindneſs; and to demonſtrate the reality of this change of his mind, there is an inſtance of his freely returning a conſiderable ſum of Money to a perſon from whom he had won it ſome years before by Gaming.</p>
            <p>Such actions, and the ſeeming ſincerity of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57818:4"/>raiſed his eſteem yet higher with all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of that Party, who had ſuch an opinion of his Wiſdom and Abilities, that when King <hi>Charles</hi> I. called that Parliament in 1640. which for its dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was afterward Named the Long, he was by the Intereſt of his Friends elected Parliament-man for the Town of <hi>Cambridge.</hi> Soon after this the War began between the King and Parliament, one Party declaring they took Arms for defending the Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives of the Crown, and the other the Priviledges of Parliaments, and Liberties of the People.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as ever this fatal diviſion happened, wherein ſo many Thouſands afterward loſt their Lives and Eſtates, <hi>Cromwel,</hi> whoſe inclination was always Martial, preſently ingaged in the quarrel, and having obtained a Commiſſion from the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, quickly raiſed a Troop of Horſe for their ſervice, of the moſt promiſing men he could chooſe; and to try their Valour in jeſt, before they came to exerciſe it in earneſt, he ſecretly ordered a dozen of them to iſſue out ſuddenly upon the reſt, with a Trumpet ſounding a Charge, as if they came from ſome of the Kings Garriſons that were not far off, which they performed with ſo much briskneſs, that about twenty of the new Troopers fled away with all poſſible ſpeed, whom <hi>Cromwel</hi> having reproached for their Cowardice, diſmounted and caſhier'd, mounting their Horſes with perſons of a more coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious temper.</p>
            <p>He was likewiſe nominated a Commiſſioner in the Ordinance for ſettling the Militia, whereby the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Countries aſſociated themſelves together, declaring that they would ſtand by the Parliament againſt all Oppoſers, and <hi>Cromwel</hi> being ſenſible that the Univerſity of <hi>Cambridge</hi> was moſt inclined to the Royal Intereſt, he had a particular regard to the place of his Education, and very dexterouſly ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red both the Town, and a great quantity of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57818:5"/>Plate, even at the very inſtant when it was upon the point of being conveyed to the King at <hi>Oxford.</hi> After this he forms a Garriſon at <hi>Whitleſea,</hi> where a Bridge joins the County of <hi>Norfolk</hi> with the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>The King in oppoſition to the Aſſociation which the Parliament had ſettled, iſſued out his Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Array, which was firſt deſigned to be put in Execution by Sir <hi>Henry Conniſby,</hi> High Sheriff of <hi>Hartford-ſhire</hi> at St. <hi>Albans,</hi> who thereby intended to have raiſed the County for the aid of the King, but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57818:5"/>which was a fatal blow to the Kings Intereſt, and <hi>Lyn Regis,</hi> which the Royaliſts maintained, being ſoon after ſurrendred, was ſo great a diſcouragement to them, that during the whole War they could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver after find any opportunity to ſhew their affection to the Kings Cauſe.</p>
            <p>The Aſſociated Counties being thus firmly ſettled for the Parliament, <hi>Cromwel</hi> was made Lieutenant-General to the Earl of <hi>Mancheſter,</hi> who had a ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate command of thoſe Aſſociated Counties, and was now ordered to march <hi>Northward</hi> with thoſe Forces, and join with General <hi>Leſly</hi> and the <hi>Scots,</hi> aſſiſted by Sir <hi>Tho. Fairfax,</hi> for reinforcing the Siege before <hi>York,</hi> then beleaguer'd by <hi>Leſly:</hi> In his march he blocks up the Garriſon of <hi>Newark,</hi> and meeting ſome of their party at <hi>Grantham,</hi> he charged them with ſuch fury, that though much ſuperiour to him in number, yet himſelf marching in the Van, he ſoon put them to flight. Having thus made a quick diſpatch at <hi>Newark,</hi> he proceeded to <hi>York,</hi> in which the Marqueſs of <hi>Newcastle</hi> had put the beſt part of the Kings Forces.</p>
            <p>The King having had an advantage againſt the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> at <hi>Leſtichell</hi> in <hi>Cornwall,</hi> ſent away Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> as General, with a very powerful Army to raiſe the Siege of <hi>York,</hi> which he judged to be of great Importance; the three Generals, <hi>Leſly, Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter,</hi> and <hi>Fairfax,</hi> drew off their Forces from the City to fight him, as knowing if they got the day, it muſt ſurrender to the Victor without blows. The Prince having notice of their raiſing the Siege, ſent ſome of his Troops towards <hi>Haſſam-More,</hi> to face General <hi>Leſly</hi> and his <hi>Scots,</hi> but in the mean time en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters into <hi>York</hi> with two thouſand Horſe, and all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions for their relief; after which, he reſolved to fight the Parliamentarians, though much diſſwaded by the Marqueſs of <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> knowing what hazard the Eſtates of the Kings Friends would run if he
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57818:6"/>ſhould miſcarry, and that upon the fate of this Battel the gain or loſs of the <hi>North</hi> depended. However, the Prince pretending to march to <hi>Tadcaſter, Leſly</hi> with his Army followed him, but returning again ſuddenly to <hi>Marſton-Moor,</hi> he takes what advantages of ground he thinks fit, and <hi>Leſly</hi> ſoon coming up, the Generals Marſhall'd their Army in the beſt order they could for the ſhortneſs of time, <hi>Fairfax</hi> and <hi>Leſlies</hi> Horſe making the Right Wing, and the <hi>Scot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Armies being drawn up in this form, the firſt Onſet was performed by Prince <hi>Ruperts</hi> Left Wing, with ſuch fury as they broke the Parliaments Right, and perſuing their advantage with much Vigour, the Earth was ſoon covered with the ſlain.</p>
            <p>In the mean while <hi>Cromwel</hi> being in the Left Wing, and ignorant of the misfortune of the Right, with much Courage ingages the Princes Right Wing, which quickly altered the Scene of Affairs, and ſnatch'd the Victory out of the Princes Hand, who ſeemed in probability to have obtained it, for the Lord <hi>Fairfaxes</hi> Forces were totally diſſipated, and beaten out of the Field, when <hi>Cromwel</hi> with his Troops fell on with ſuch Reſolution, that he routed the Prince and his reſerves, and with the ſame Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence charged the Marqueſs of <hi>Newcastles</hi> Foot, who yet ſtood till the Field was almoſt cleared, and then were forced to give way to the number of their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; there were many ſlain, eſpecially in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit, and <hi>Cromwel</hi> he obtained the Name of <hi>Ironſides,</hi> from the Impenetrable firmneſs of his Troops, which no force could ſeparate or break. It is thought to be the bloudieſt Fight that happened during the War, it being judged near ten thouſand men were ſlain on both ſides. Upon this defeat, Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> and his Followers charge the miſcarriage upon the <hi>Marqueſs</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:57818:6"/>of <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> and he again upon them, who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon left the Kingdom. The conſequence of this Victory was the rendition of York, which being now afreſh beſieged, and deſpairing of ſuccour, Sir Thomas Glemham, the Valiant Governour was obliged to deliver it up.</p>
            <p>This ſucceſs raiſed <hi>Cromwels</hi> reputation higher ſtill, and the Parliament at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly pleaſed with his Courage and Prudence, that when he ſaw part of the Army routed, yet with an undaunted preſence of mind, he took occaſion from thence to animate his Souldiers to the more vigorous recovery of the Victory, even when the Scots had timorouſly left the Field, and of whom for this and other reaſons, he had no great opinion afterward. Several other Exploits he was ingaged in both in the North and Weſt, even before he had any conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable command, for while he was in the ſame quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty under the Earl of <hi>Mancheſter,</hi> he was ordered to return to the North, to oppoſe the King then marching triumphantly from the Weſt after the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat of Eſſex, who having been unfortunate in his Enterprizes, <hi>Cromwel</hi> this ſucceſsful Commander was joined with him, who at the ſecond Battel at Newberry, about four months after that at <hi>Marſton-Moor,</hi> was favoured, though not with a compleat Victory, yet with ſuch good fortune, that where his Troops were, the Royaliſts gave back with ſo much precipitation, as greatly endangered the Kings per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, had not the Earl of <hi>Cleveland</hi> interpoſed, and with much hazard prevented the perſuit.</p>
            <p>The War ſtill continuing with much bloodſhed, and no period in probability like to be put to it, the Parliament apprehended want of Conduct in ſome of their chief Commanders, and therefore reſolved to new model their Army, and that no offence might be given to any of their own Members by being diſcard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they paſs the ſelf-denying Ordinance ſo called,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:57818:7"/>whereby they declare, <q>That no member of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould bear Office in the Army, or Garriſons, but altogether attend the ſervice of the Houſe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they had leave for ſo doing; and that within forty days from the publiſhing thereof.</q> By which proceeding, the Earls of <hi>Eſſex, Mancheſter</hi> and <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>high,</hi> Sir <hi>William Waller,</hi> Sir <hi>Philip Stapleton,</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers others, were diſmiſs'd; after which they took care to recruit their Forces, which were much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed by ſickneſs, and the late defeat in the <hi>Weſt,</hi> and in a ſhort time they muſtered a compleat Army of twenty one thouſand; that is, fourteen thouſand Foot, ſix thouſand Horſe, and one thouſand Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons, over whom they conſtituted Sir <hi>Tho. Fairfax</hi> General, who gave out divers Commiſſions to them who were then newly called Independants, and among others, <hi>Ireton</hi> was raiſed to be Commiſſary-General of the Horſe; who had newly married one of <hi>Cromwels</hi> Daughters, and was as great a Politician as himſelf.</p>
            <p>Upon publiſhing the fore-mentioned Ordinance, which was in the year 1645, <hi>Cromwel</hi> who was then in the <hi>Weſt</hi>-country, in obedience thereto, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately returns toward <hi>London,</hi> and having notice that General <hi>Fairfax</hi> was at <hi>Windſor,</hi> he went to wait upon him by the way, and take his leave of him; but the Parliament were too ſenſible of his uſefulneſs and conduct to diſcharge him, and therefore the next morning, as ſoon as he was riſen, a Commiſſion was ſent him to be Lieutenant-General of the Horſe to the whole Army. This alteration gave great hopes to the Royal party, of future ſucceſs againſt this new Army, ſo many principal Commanders being laid aſide and diſcontented, and ſuch a number of unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced Youths Liſted; but theſe expectations ſoon vaniſhed, for <hi>Cromwel</hi> by virtue of the diſpenſing power of the Parliament, being ſtill continued and advanced to ſo great a command, to make it appear
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57818:7"/>that they were not miſtaken in their choice, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly proceeds to action, being ſent by Fairfax with a flying party of Horſe and Dragoons to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a convoy of two thouſand Horſe, conſiſting of the Queens, the Earl of Northamptons, and Collonel Palmers Regiments, who with ſome other Troops, were marching to Oxford, with a deſign to bring off the King, and the Train of Artillery, and to procure Recruits for the Army, and ſo join with the Kings main mid-land Forces under Prince Rupert, then about Worceſter, and the borders of Wales, and then take the field. In this exploit Cromwel was ſo extream diligent, that with extraordinary celerity he met with, ſurprized and routed them at Iſlip-bridge, taking five hundred Horſe, and two hundred priſoners, with the Queens Standard, and many perſons of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; and puſhing on his ſucceſs, having notice that Sir William Vaughan, with three hundred and fifty Foot, were marching toward Radcot-bridge, he followed them, taking their commander, Lieutenant Coll. Littleton, and two hundred other priſoners, perſuing the reſt to Blechingdon-houſe, where Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel Windebank was Governour, and in the height of his Victories ſummoned him to an immediate ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render, or elſe to expect the utmoſt vengeance of an inraged Souldiery. The Governour terrified with theſe threats, and being over perſwaded by ſome Ladies, who were there come to viſit his Bride, he being newly married, and having little hopes of relief from Oxford, delivered up the Houſe with all the Arms and Ammunition therein; for which, when he came to Oxford, he was ſhot to death by ſentence of a Council of War.</p>
            <p>This Enterprize was reckoned as a happy Omen of his future ſucceſs in his new honour, and the prudence of the Parliament magnified in continuing ſo deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a commander in the Army; who to ſecure his reputation, reſolved upon a more dangerous attempt,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:57818:8"/>to reduce Faringdon-Houſe, of which Sir George Liſle, a perſon of Invincible courage, was Governour, and a Garriſon which had been of great advantage to the King. To effect this conſiderable ſervice, he took ſix hundred of M. Gen. Browns Foot at Abing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, with which he inſtantly ſtorm'd the place, but was as ſtoutly repulſed, and forced to retire with the loſs of fifty of his Soulders, and in his retreat was attackt by a party of L. Gorings Horſe, lately come from the ſiege of Taunton, who gave Cromwel the firſt check he had yet met with, taking three colours, and Major Bethel priſoner, and then returned to the ſiege at Taunton.</p>
            <p>At this time Fairfax had order to march to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of Taunton, and Cromwel was left behind with Brown, to watch the motions of the Kings Army at Oxford, who were then ready to take the field, and to prevent them from joining a brave body of Horſe that were coming out of Worceſter-ſhire, under the command of the Princes Rupert and Maurice: But the Royal Army was grown ſo potent, that Cromwel durſt not attempt either to fight, or hinder their march, ſo that Fairfax was preſently remanded and ordered to lye before Oxford, to oblige the King to ſecure that place, and upon advantage to fight him; when Intelligence came that the King having joined the two Princes, and raiſed the ſiege of Cheſter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaguered by Sir William Brereton, was now march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing toward the Aſſociated Counties, wherein lay the ſtrength of the Parliament, whereupon Cromwel was ordered with all ſpeed to ſecure the Iſle of Ely, as being a Frontier to the reſt of the country: But the King went and ſate down before Leiceſter, and ſoon took it, which ſo alarm'd the parliament, that they inſtantly diſpatch'd Orders to Fairfax to riſe from Oxford, and ſeek out and fight the Kings Army, who (as he writ to his Queen) was then in a more hopeful condition than during the War. Fairfax
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:57818:8"/>obeyed this Order, and Cromwel being recruited with ſix hundred Horſe of the Aſſociation, came to join the Army then marching toward Northampton.</p>
            <p>The General had information that the King had Quartered his Foot and Carriages upon Burrough-Hill near Daventry, as if he intended there to expect him, but it was only to tarry till the twelve hundred Horſe, ſent as a Convoy to the Cattel taken within Leiceſter and Northampton-ſhire, for relief of Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, were returned, deſigning afterward the reducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Pomfret-caſtle in the North, and all the other places loſt ſince Marſton-Moor, and if Fairfax follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, to have fought him with the firſt advantage, which he could not do ſo conveniently where the Parliament had their Garriſons. But Cromwel ſoon diſappointed this project, by whoſe counſel Ireton was diſpatch'd with a Detachment of Horſe to take an account of the poſture of the Kings Army, with Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that if they marched Northward, he ſhould skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh and employ them in the Rear, till the whole Army could arrive and ingage. The day before the Battel, the General marched to Gilsborough, five miles from Burrough-hills, from whence the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aliſts, their H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>e being come back from Oxford, were bending their courſe Northward; and the next Night the King was extreamly ſurprized to find Ireton give an alarm to his Quarters at Naſeby, from whence, about eleven a clock, the King departed, ſpeeding to Harborough, where Prince Rupert and the Van of the Army were, and a Council of War being ſummoned, it was reſolved on, as being the Kings opinion, that to ſecure his rear, they ſhould march no farther North, but preſently give the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my battel, depending much upon the Valour of the Foot, who were lately animated by the plunder of Leiceſter.</p>
            <p>This advice was followed, though moſt of the Officers were for ſtaying till the Lord Gorings Forces
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:57818:9"/>came up, but the King being much ſtronger in Horſe doubted not of ſucceſs, and the other were as ready to ingage, ſo that both agreeing in diſcord, a large Field near Naſeby was the place choſen by both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties for the Stage of this woful Tragedy, wherein Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers fought againſt Sons, and Brothers gave death to each other, all obligations of kindred and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip being laid aſide, occaſioned by that unnatural ſpirit of diviſion, which Heaven for our crimes had ſent amongſt us. The King had Intelligence that Fairfax for fear was retreating to Northampton, but found it a miſtake, he being then imployed in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhalling his Army in Naſeby field, and waiting for his coming, Cromwel and Whaliey commanding the right wing, and Ireton the left. The Kings front was compoſed of a gallant body of Horſe, the foot made a ſecond body, the right wing commanded by Prince Rupert and Maurice, the left wing by Sir Jacob Aſtley, and the Lord Langley commanded the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Brigade of Horſe, other ancient commanders who having been in the Low-countries having their ſeveral poſts, the King himſelf being Generaliſſimo. Theſe being drawn out with the reſerves, took up the whole bredth of the field: The Parliaments foot made a firm body in the midſt, commanded by Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor General Skippon, ſecured by the Horſe on each ſide. Prince Rupert charged firſt with ſuch fury up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Ireton, notwithſtanding their valiant reſiſtance, that the left wing which he commanded was utterly routed, and his men put to flight, and driven upon the Kings foot, of which Ireton was wounded in the Thigh with a Halbert, and kept priſoner during the fight, and the field eleared on that ſide, the Prince perſuing them through the Town, and then ſell upon the Waggons, where being repulſed, he loſt ſo much time, that Cromwel and Fairfax who had not yet ſtirr'd from their ground, but with ſhort ſpeeches and ejaculations were encouraging their men, came
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:57818:9"/>up, and Cromwel clapping ſpurs to his Horſe, charged clear through three bodies of Langdales Brigade, and utterly routed them, never ceaſing till he had beat that whole wing of the Kings Army from their ground, without any poſſibility of rallying; ſo that having as it were raked the field before him, dividing the Horſe from the Foot, they were rendred uſeleſs to each other. In this encounter, one of the Kings commanders knowing Cromwel, advanced briskly before the head of his Troops, to exchange a ſingle bullet with him, and was with the like gallantry en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred by him, both ſides forbearing to come in till their Piſtols being diſcharged, the Kings Officer with a ſlaunting back blow of a broad ſword, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to cut the ribbon that tyed Cromwels Murrion, and with a draw threw it off his Head, and now rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to repeat his ſtroke, Cromwels party came in and reſcued him, and one of them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The Horſe being ſeparated from the Foot, as you heard, fled toward Leiceſter, Cromwel ſent ſome few Troops in perſuit, to prevent their rallying, and himſelf in the mean time joyning with his own foot, ſo incompaſſed the Kings Infantry, that notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the courage they had ſhewed that day, ſo that their very enemies admired them, yet being tired and hopeleſs of relief, ſeeing death on every ſide, they laid down their Arms, and beg'd for Quarter.</p>
            <p>This memorable Battel was fought June 14. 1645. The Parliamentarians word was, God with Us. The Royaliſts, God and Queen Mary; and the ſucceſs of it gave an abſolute and undoubted Victory to the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:57818:10"/>Parliament, there being almoſt five thouſand pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners carried to London, the Kings Standard, and a hundred other colours were taken, with all the Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and a very rich Booty, a great quantity of gold and ſilver, and all the ſecret Letters of the King, which were carried to London, and publickly read before a great Aſſembly of Citizens, where many Members of Parliament were preſent, and leave was given to as many as pleaſed, or knew the Kings hand, to refute them if they were counterfeit. But ſo few were ſlain in this fight, that a Reader may juſtly wonder how ſo many priſoners ſhould be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and ſo much wealth gotten with the loſs of ſo little blood, for on the Kings ſide ſcarce four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred were ſlain, and on the Parliaments not an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, and herein particularly the Kings dammage appeared very conſiderable, that he had loſt a brave Army, lately heightned with ſucceſs by the taking of Leiceſter, and that there ſeemed no poſſibility of raiſing another, the Victors proſecuting their advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage with ſo much vigilance and impetuoſity, for marching to Leiceſter it was ſoon delivered to them, where Fairfax leaving a Garriſon, reſolved to hinder the King from recruiting himſelf, and followed him ſo cloſe, marching Weſtward, both in perſuit of him, and to raiſe the ſiege of Taunton, which had been a great while blockt up by the Lord Goring, and held out to admiration, but upon the approach of the Parliaments Army, the ſiege was raiſed to their great joy, who ſtill perſue Goring, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take him near Lampert, where they ingage and put them to flight, but Cromwel would not ſuffer part of the Horſe to perſue, till being all come-up toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he himſelf led them on with ſuch notable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, that moſt of the foot were made priſoners, and almoſt all the great Guns taken. From hence he marched to Bridgwater, which though of conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſtrength, and defended with much courage, yet
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:57818:10"/>is ſoon taken by ſtorm, for Sir Tho. Fairfax ſits down before it, and after ſummons, aſſaults the Town ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry deſperately, gaining the lower part thereof, and then ſends a ſecond ſummons, telling them, <q>That their denial wrought no other thoughts of compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in him, but only to Women and Children, who might ſuffer by the Governours obſtinacy.</q> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon divers Ladies, Gentlewomen and Children, came out of the Town, and then a ſecond aſſault was made ſo effectually, that the Governour capitulated, and ſurrendred it, there being a thouſand Officers and Souldiers priſoners, forty four barrels of powder, fifteen hundred Arms, forty four pieces of Ordnance, and four hundred weight of match.</p>
            <p>About this time a ſort of people armed themſelves in the Weſt, and took upon them the Name of Club<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, declaring that they would permit no Armies to Quarter within their bounds, and were ſo hardy as to make terms with the General, as if by Club-Law they would force him out of their Country, though fluſht with Victory, imagining that with their Clubs, they were able to force their ſwords from thoſe who had ſo lately deprived ſo many gallant men of theirs. But Cromwel doubting the event of ſuch riotous proceedings, having Intelligence of the place of their aſſembling, marches toward them with a party of Horſe, though they were four thouſand ſtrong, and Incamped on the top of a Hill, with their Enſigns diſplayed, and this Motto on them:
<q>
                  <l>'If you offer to plunder, and take our Cattel,</l>
                  <l>'You may be ſure we'll give you Battel.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>But Cromwel reſolves to venture it, and preſently charging up the Hill, he utterly routs and puts them to flight, making four hundred priſoners, whom he carried to Sherburn, Sir Lewis Dives being Governor of the Caſtle, which was then beſieged by Fairfax, and in a ſhort time taken by ſtorm.</p>
            <p>Briſtol was reckoned a place of Importance, as
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:57818:11"/>being the greateſt and moſt wealthy City in all the Weſt, wherein Prince Rupert was at that time with near five thouſand Horſe and Foot, and all neceſſary proviſions. When the Parliaments Army came be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it, the General ſends a ſummons to the Prince to deliver the City, which being rejected, Cromwel and ſome other chief Officers adviſed the ſtorming part of it, whereupon the Prince propoſed to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render, <q>Upon condition every man ſhould march away in the height of honour, with their Arms, Colours flying, Trumpers, Drums beating, and as much Powder and Match as they could carry about them, with Baggage, Horſe, Arms, ten pieces of Cannon, and fifty Barrels of powder. Laſtly, the Lines and Fortifications to be ſlighted, and the City to be no more a Garriſon.</q> But theſe conditions being thought too favourable, they proceeded to ſtorm it ſo warmly, that the Prince, though he uſed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 line">
                  <desc>〈1 line〉</desc>
               </gap>

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, Wherein were found one hundred and forty pieces of Cannon mounted, one hundred Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels of powder, and Victuals in the Royal-Fort for one hundred and fifty men for three hundred and twenty days, the Caſtle Victualled for near half ſo long, the Prince had in Garriſon two thouſand five hundred Foot, one thouſand Horſe, beſides above one thouſand of the Trained Bands and Auxiliaries, ſo that the gaining this place was of great conſequence to the Parliament.</p>
            <p>After this, Cromwel marches without delay with a Detachment of four Regiments, to beſiege the ſtrong Caſtle of the Devizes, to the natural Fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations whereof, Sir Charles Lloyd the Governour, had made ſeveral Ingenious additions, ſo that judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it almoſt impregnable, he ſent no other return to the ſummons but, Win it and Wear it. Yet the fortune of Cromwel prevailed againſt all difficulties, and his Name brought terrour where-ever he came,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:57818:11"/>ſo that he quickly forced the Governour to comply, and deliver the place upon terms. Wincheſter ran the ſame Fate, after the Governour had been morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the battery of ſome Cannon and Mortars; where Cromwel, who was conſtantly punctual to Articles, having notice that ſome of his men had In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringed them, he cauſed one of them to be hanged for example to others, and ſent the reſt to Oxford, to the Governour Sir Tho. Glenham, that he might inflict what puniſhment upon them he pleaſed.</p>
            <p>The next Exploit wherein our Heroe was concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, was the reducing of Baſing-houſe, which ſeemed to defie all attempts that ſhould be made againſt it, being the Manſion-houſe of the Marqueſs of Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter, built upon a riſing ground, and ſurrounded with a brick Rampart which was lined with Earth, and all incompaſſed with a dry Ditch: The Marqueſs was reſolved to defend it, though at firſt there was none but his own Family, and one hundred Muſque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers from Oxford, but afterward the King ſupplied him as occaſion required. This was not the firſt time this Garriſon had been attackt without ſucceſs, at firſt the Collonels, Norton and Harvey, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward by Sir William Waller, with ſeven thouſand men, and though ſome termed him William the Conquerour, yet he received here ſuch rude treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as only incouraged the beſieged to defend it with the greater vigour, who in ſeveral gallant ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies did him very great damage, ſo that the place ſeemed Impregnable for ſome time; but Cromwel having ſettled all matters at Wincheſter, with the late Governour Sir William Ogle, he marches next day to Baſing, and no ſooner arrived, but he immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly raiſes a ſtrong battery, that quickly made it capable of being aſſaulted: Which advantage he inſtantly perceiving, orders a ſtorm to be made from the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Poſts, which though it ſeemed full of danger, and might have ſhockt an ordinary courage, yet
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:57818:12"/>Cromwel, who thought no place Invincible, and that the more danger there was, the more honour would accrue from it, leads on his men with ſuch fury, that the beſieged ſoon found themſelves incapable to make any further reſiſtance, and ſo were forced to yield upon Articles. The gaining of Baſing was reckoned a great piece of ſervice to the Nation, whereby the Road was opened for Trade from London to the Weſt, which had been long obſtructed by this Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon. He goes from hence to Longford-houſe near Salisbury, but the Governour deſpaired of preſerving that, after Baſing had been forced to ſurrender to Cromwels victorious arms, and therefore upon the firſt ſummons delivered it up.</p>
            <p>He then marches with the Army, commanded by Fairfax, toward the Weſt, and in December they took Tiverton, and with ſtrange ſucceſs ſtormed and took Dartmouth, and afterwards drove the Kings Armies into Cornwal, and at Torrington gave Hopton a great overthrow. In February they entred Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wal, and obliged Prince Charles to retire from thence, and fail to the Iſles of Scilly, and ſoon after Hoptons Forces were Disbanded and ſent away, and Penden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis-Caſtle being ſurrendred to Coll. Forreſcue, the whole County of Cornwal, and the Weſt, were by Fairfax and Cromwel reduced to the Obedience of the Parliament, and nothing remained in the North but the Garriſon of Newark, ſo that the Royaliſts hopes were very low, only they had ſome expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from a party ſtill remaining under Sir Jacob Aſtley, but Coll. Morgan encountring him near Stow in the holds, utterly Routed him, and took himſelf and ſixteen hundred of his men priſoners, ſo that this hope ſoon vaniſh'd like the reſt; when he was ſeized, he ſpake aloud theſe words, <q>You have done your work, and wholly vanquiſhed the Kings party,</q> unleſs your own diſſentions raiſe them again.</p>
            <p>After this, Newark, the ſtrongeſt Garriſon in the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:57818:12"/>North, was cloſe beſieged by Leven, Pointe and Roſſiter, while Fairfax haſtened to beſiege Oxford it ſelf, which was the Head Quarters. The King having now no Garriſons left but this, Banbury, Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingford, Worceſter, Ragland, and Pendennis, all which in a ſhort time were alſo taken, and could only glory in this, That they had held out after Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford. The beſieged Newarkers, though the plague raged in the Town, and they began to want provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, yet ſuſtained themſelves upon hopes of ſome differences between the Engliſh and Scots, for now the Scots began to complain of want of pay, of the neglect of Church-Government, and the Covenant. The Parliament anſwered, <q>That in two years ſpace they had received above two hundred thouſand pounds for pay, beſides a vaſt ſum of money which had been extorted from the weeping Inhabitants of the Northern Counties, and that their Army had not anſwered expectation, lying idle the beſt time of the year, and if they were ſo preciſe in obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Covenant, why contrary thereto, had they put Garriſons into Newcaſtle, Tinmouth and Carliſle? Neither ought they to mention Religion, being unſettled, ſince the Parliament were conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about it, being a matter which requires time and mature deliberation.</q>
            </p>
            <p>From theſe diſſentions the King expected ſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, but yet Oxford was already block'd up by Fleetwood and Ireton, and Fairfax was daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to come and turn it into a cloſe ſiege, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore before this ſhould happen, the King reſolved to go out of the City, and conſulting with ſome of his inward Councellors, it was concluded he ſhould go to the Scots Camp, then lying before Newark; the King ſent Montruel the French Ambaſſador before, and himſelf ſoon after, as Coll. Aſhburnhams man (who had a paſs from Fairfax to go out of Oxford, about ſome private buſineſs) with a Cloak-bag behind
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:57818:13"/>him, eſcaped unknown, and came to Newark, which when the beſieged Newarkers had notice of, being in great ſtreights, they upon conditions ſurrendred the Town. The Scots ſeemed amazed at the Kings unexpected coming to them, and ſo ſignified the matter to the Engliſh Commiſſioners then on the place. Letters were inſtantly written to London and Edinburgh, and the Parliament at Weſtminſter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired the Scots to detain the King at Southwell near Newark, but contrary to this Order, they carried him to Kelham, where a greater part of their Army lay, and ſoon after without further Order, removed their Camp Northward, and carried him away to Newcaſtle with them, excuſing their departure by alledging, Newark being yielded, no work was left for them, but that as the King came to them of his own accord, unexpected, ſo he followed their Army, neither being intreated nor forbidden by them; but they ſeemed to haſten their departure, by reaſon of a rumour that Cromwel with all his Horſe was marching toward them. This action much offended the Engliſh Parliament, and they complain'd both of the Scots and the King.</p>
            <p>In the beginning of May, General Fairfax with his whole Army came before Oxford; the City was very ſtrong, having been fortified according to the moſt exact rules of Art to make it Impregnable, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vironed with regular Forts, and provided with a potent Garriſon of five thouſand valiant Souldiers, having great ſtores of all manner of proviſions, and the Governour Sir Tho. Glemham, a perſon who had ſufficiently demonſtrated his courage and conduct, in holding out York and Carliſle to the laſt extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity. The General diſpoſing his Quarters round about the City, ſummoned the Governour to ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, who returned, <q>That he would ſend to know the Kings mind,</q> and then act accordingly. This anſwer was not ſatisfactory, yet Fairfax and his
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:57818:13"/>Commanders doubting it would be a tedious Siege, were put in hopes by ſome ſpies, that it could not hold out long, by reaſon of the diviſions between the Nobility and Souldiers, the firſt being for treating now, and ſo obtain honourable conditions, which they did accordingly, and the Parliament decreed, <q>That the beſieged ſhould have the beſt conditions, rather than waſte their Army, which might be more uſeful elſewhere, for they deſigned to ſend them into Ireland,</q> againſt the Rebels there.</p>
            <p>Thus was Oxford ſurrendred, and the Garriſon marched out in ſight of Fairfax's Army, with great quiet and modeſty on both ſides: The D. of York was honourably conducted to London, where two of the Kings Children remained; thither alſo went all the Noble-men; neither were any of the beſieged denied to go to London, but the Princes Rupert and Maurice, who being commanded to go out of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, prepared for their departure. Prince Charles about this time, ſailed from Scilly with a few of his inward Counſellors to Jerſey, in order to go to his Mother in France, which the King having advice of, ſent him this ſhort Letter from Newcaſtle.</p>

            <p>Soon after the ſurrender of Oxford followed the end of this fierce War, for Worceſter, Wallingford, Pendennis and Ragland, yielded to the Victors. Peace now ſeemed to be reſtored to England, but they
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:57818:14"/>had no ſecurity, the Parliament being grievouſly troubled with factions among themſelves, and divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded under the Names of Presbyterians and Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, not only in matters of Church-Government, but often in their Votes, and in tranſacting almoſt all other buſineſs, and this humour ſpread it ſelf into the City, Country, and Camp; and the Parliament doubting Coll. Maſſeys Forces might muriny, upon that account ſent Fairfax to Disband them, being two thouſand five hundred Horſe; which was qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly done in eight days time, though they did not then receive their pay.</p>
            <p>The Scots, as you have heard, carrying the King into the North, the parliament Voted, <q>That the perſon of the King ſhould be diſpoſed of by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of both Houſes of the parliament of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land: But the Scots denied to deliver him up,</q> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging, That he was no leſs King of England than Scotland, which cauſed great diſſention between the two Nations. But at length, upon paying the Scots two hundred thouſand pounds, they agreed to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver up Berwick, Carliſle, and Newcaſtle, to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of England, and the Kings perſon alſo, to the Engliſh Commiſſioners, to be carried into the South, who was received with great reſpect and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour by the Earls of Pembroke and Denbigh, and the other Commiſſioners, and by them waited on with much obſervance, and an honourable Guard to his palace at Holmby in Northampton-ſhire.</p>
            <p>But the Civil Wars being ended, a diſſention more than Civil aroſe among the Conquerors, which ſtill increaſed under the Names of Presbyterians and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependants, and extreamly imbittered the minds of men againſt each other, one party complaining, That the Covenant was broken: The other, That it was not rightly Interpreted by them. And on both ſides were men of Reputation; and ſeveral petitions were drawn up againſt the Army, (lately ſo much
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:57818:14"/>admired) as maintainers of the Independent party, who then lay about Saffron-Walden in Eſſex. Yea, it was debated in parliament, whether they ſhould be Disbanded or not, which Cromwel, who ſided with the Independents, having notice of, he thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, with Ireton, inſinuated into the common Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, That the parliament intended to Disband them without their Arrears, or elſe to ſend them into Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, to dye of Sickneſs or Famine, which cauſed the Souldiers to uſe contumelious ſpeeches againſt the two Houſes; and thereupon a Council of Officers was ſet up, conſiſting of two Commiſſion-Officers, and two private Souldiers out of every Regiment, to meet and conſult for the good of the Army, and to draw up and preſent all their Grievances to the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and theſe were called Adjutators: Who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving met, by the Inſtigation of Cromwel, and ſome others, that made them ſenſible of their own ſtrength, they reſolved upon ſeizing the King at Holmby-Houſe, under pretence of freeing him from that nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row reſtraint under which he was kept by the parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments Order. To effect which, Cornet Joyce is ſent thither with five hundred Horſe, who took the King out of the parliaments Commiſſioners hands, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried him along with them in the Army. This the General certifies in a Letter to the parliament, affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to be done without his conſent, and that the reaſon alledged by the Actors was, Becauſe certain perſons had deſigned to take away his Majeſty, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to gather ſtrength to make a new War, which they were able and ready to prove.</p>
            <p>When this was known, an Order paſſed both Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Parliament, and was ſent to the General; 1. <q>That the King ſhould reſide at Richmond. 2. That he ſhould be attended by the ſame perſons he was at Holmby. 3. That Roffiters Regiment ſhould Guard him.</q> And the Presbyterians, who were the greater number in Parliament, being fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:57818:15"/>alarm'd by theſe proceedings, reſolved to divide the Army, and ſend part of it to Ireland, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to caſhiere Cromwel and his Aſſiſtants: And they publiſh a Declaration, forbidding the Souldiers to Petition the Parliament as being under their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand: Likewiſe they had privately reſolved to ſeize upon Cromwel, then in London, who having notice of it, got ſecretly and haſtily out of Town, and with full ſpeed rid to Tripoly-Heath, ſo that his Horſe was all in a foam, and was received with the acclamations of the whole Army, to whom he diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the intentions and actions of the Parliament; whereupon, they entred into an Ingagement, Not to Disband till the propoſals they had drawn up for regulating all matters were anſwered, and then marching to New-Marker, they ſubſcribed thereto, Cromwel putting his Name firſt, and the reſt of the Officers generally followed, ſo that ſeveral parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Rolls were filled with their Names. The next day was brought from the General, and his Council of Officers, an Impeachment of eleven Members of the Houſe of Commons, who were counted the chief of the Presbyterian party, namely, Sir W. Waller, Coll. Maſſey, Sir John Clothworthy, Sir Denzil Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis, Coll. Long, Mr. Anthony Nicholas, Sir Ph. Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleton, Mr. Glyn, Sir John Maynard, Sir William Lewis, and Coll. Edward Harley, charging them with hindring the relief of Ireland, obſtructing of Juſtice, and acting ſomewhat againſt the Army, and the Laws of England. The Members declared themſelves ready to anſwer, but the Army would have them ſecluded from their ſeats in Parliament, till they had brought in their anſwer; whereupon they withdrew themſelves by conſent for ſix months. After which the Army marched nearer to London, and came to Bedford, the King going to the Earl of Bedfords-Houſe, near Wouborn.</p>
            <p>And now the Citizens being for the Presbyterian
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:57818:15"/>party in the Houſe, and the Independents for the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, great diviſions happened in London, for the changing that Parliament having ordered the Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia of the City, which had been eſtabliſhed the 4th. of May, and put others better affected to the Army in their rooms, the Presbyterian party were extreamly incenſed thereat, and came two days after to the Houſe with a petition, accompanied by a multitude of Citizens and Apprentices, who coming to the door of the Commons, cried out, That they muſt grant their petition before they roſe. Whereupon the Houſe beginning to riſe, they took the Speaker, and held him in the Chair, detaining him and the reſt of the Members, till they forced another Order from them, 'That the King ſhould come to London. After which they adjourned to July 30. but then both Speakers were abſent, having withdrawn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Army, whereupon two new Speakers were choſen, the Lord Hunſdon, and Mr. Henry Pel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Barriſter, by whom the following Orders were made that day. <q>1. That the King ſhould come to London. 2. That the Militia of London ſhould have power to raiſe Forces for defence of the City. 3. They ſhould alſo have power to chooſe a General for thoſe Forces; and that the eleven impeached Members ſhould return to their feats.</q> The Citizens armed with theſe Orders, preſently proceed to raiſe Forces, chooſing Maſſey their General.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, the Lords and Commons which had left London, conſulting with the General, and chief Commanders of the Army, made an Order, <q>That all Acts and Decrees that had paſſed on July 26. and ſince, ſhould be accounted null and void, and that they did adhere to the Declaration of the General and Council of the Army.</q> It was likewiſe decreed, <q>That the General with his Army ſhould march to London.</q> Upon whoſe approach the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens, who made ſome ſemblance of oppoſition,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:57818:16"/>meeting in Common-council, and finding it impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſuddenly to raiſe Forces to oppoſe them, they ſent to the General for a pacification, which by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Members of Parliament, was granted them on theſe conditions: <q>1. That they ſhould deſert the Parliament now ſitting, and the eleven Impeached Members. 2. To recal their late Declaration. 3. To relinquiſh their preſent Militia. 4. To de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver up to the General all their Forts, and the Tower of London. 5. To Disband all the Forces they had raiſed.</q> All which, not daring to deny, were inſtantly ratified, and ſo Auguſt 6. 1647. the Army marched triumphantly through London to Weſtminſter, with the two Speakers, and the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Parliament, whom they reſtored to their former Sears, and the eleven ſecluded Members left London, ſome going beyond Sea, and others with paſſes to their Houſes in the Country. Both Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, in the Name of the whole Parliament, gave thanks to the General, and made him Commander of all the Forces in England and Wales, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable of the Tower of London; a months pay was likewiſe given to the Army for a gratuity. The next day Fairfax, Cromwel, Skippon, and the other Commanders, marched from Weſtminſter through London to the Tower, where ſome commands, and the Militia, were altered; and to curb the City, her Militia was divided, Weſtminſter and Southwark having power to command their own Trained Bands. And thus was the Presbyterian party depreſſed, and all things managed according to the Inclination of the Independents and the Army.</p>
            <p>After this Fairfax marched out of London, quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering his Souldiers in the Towns and Villages adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, only leaving ſome Regiments about White hall and the Mewſe, to guard the Parliament, his head Quarters being at Putney; and the King about the middle of Auguſt, after divers removes, was at length
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:57818:16"/>brought to Hampton-court, where he ſeemed not at all reſtrained, but lived like a Prince in all the ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor of a Court, all ſorts of people being freely ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to kiſs his hands, and wait upon him; yea, his ſervants from beyond Sea, even thoſe who had been Voted Delinquents, as Aſhburnham, Barkley, and the reſt, were permitted by the Army to have ſafe recourſe to him, which was generally wondred at. About this time a diſturbance aroſe in the Army by a party called Levellers, ſome of whom were ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed at Ware, and the principal ſticklers ſhot to death; others Impriſoned, and all their favourers caſhier'd, twenty being diſcarded out of one Troop.</p>
            <p>And now propoſitions were ſent to the King at Hampton-court, agreed upon by both Houſes, and with the concurrence of the Scotch Commiſſioners but the King refuſed to comply with them; for Lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>don and Lancrick, newly come out of Scotland, having privately diſcours'd with the King, ſent Letters to the Parliament, requiring, <q>That the King may come to London, and there perſonally treat with the Parliament about the matters in controverſie:</q> Though not long before they denied it to be juſt, that before the King had given ſatisfaction and ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to the people, he ſhould be admitted to London, or to any perſonal Treaty with the Parliament, and refuſed to receive him into Scotland, leſt he might raiſe commotions there; but they alledged in their defence, That the King had been taken from Holmby againſt his will, and without the conſent of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſtill remained under the power of an Army, not in that freedom proper for treating of matters of ſo great concernment. But while the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament were framing propoſitions, they were ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly ſurprized with the news that the King was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly withdrawn from Hampton-court, Letters co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming from Cromwel about midnight to the Speaker: For Nov. 12. whilſt the Commiſſioners of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:57818:17"/>and Collonel Whaley, who commanded the Guard, expected when the King would come out of his Chamber to ſupper, and wondred at his long ſtay, at laſt, about Nine a clock, ſome going in, miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the King, finding his Cloak, and a Letter written with his own hand to the Commiſſioners, to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to the Parliament, wherein having diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed about captivity, and the ſweetneſs of liberty, he proteſted before God, <q>He did not withdraw to diſturb the publick peace, but for his ſafety, againſt which he underſtood there was a Treaſonable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy, &amp;c. and that if he might be heard with freedom, honour, and ſafety, he ſhould inſtantly break through this cloud of retirement, and ſhew himſelf the Father of his Country.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Parliament ſtartled at his departure, ſent ſome perſons to the Sea-coaſts, to prevent his going beyond Sea; and when it was reported he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed in London, Ordered, <q>That if any man ſhould cloſely detain the Kings perſon, he ſhould be pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh'd with loſs of Eſtate and Life.</q> But this cloud ſoon diſſolved, Letters coming from Coll. Hammond, Governour of the Iſle of Wight, that the King was come thither, and had delivered himſelf into his pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ection, and that he would diſpoſe of him as the Parliament ſhould appoint, who commending Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond, ordered, That he ſhould Guard the King with diligence, and wait on with reſpect and honour, and that all neceſſaries ſhould be ſent him.</p>
            <p>The King ſent a long Letter from thence to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, wherein he deſired to come to a perſonal Treaty at London, which was alſo vehemently preſſed by the Scots Commiſſioners: Whereupon, after a long debate, Nov. 26. they drew up four propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the form of Acts, to be ſigned by the King in the Iſle of Wight, and then he ſhould be admitted to a perſonal Treaty, which were, <q>1. To paſs an Act for ſettling the Militia of the Kingdom. 2. An
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:57818:17"/>Act for calling in all Declarations, Oaths and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations, againſt the Parliament and their adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents. 3. For Incapacitating thoſe Lords who were made after the Great-Seal was carried to Oxford, from ſitting in the Houſe of Peers thereby. A pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to be given to the two Houſes to adjourn as they ſhall think fit.</q> The Commiſſioners of Scotland de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared againſt theſe Bills, however, Dec. 24. they were preſented to the King, who underſtanding the minds of the Scots, and the Factions in London, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely refuſed to ſign them. Which deni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l was ſharply debated in the Houſe, and it was affirmed, <q>That the King by this denial, had denied his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection to the people of England, for which only ſubjection is due to him:</q> And therefore, Jan. 17. a Declaration and Votes paſſed both Houſes of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <q>That they will make no further Addreſſes to the King, nor any other to make application to him, without their Order, under penalty of High-Treaſon: That they will receive no more Meſſages from him, to both or either Houſes of Parliament, or any other perſon.</q> This was ſeconded by a Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the General and Officers of the Army, which was preſented to the Houſe, and thanks return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them for their Reſolutions to adhere to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in their proceedings concerning the King, and againſt him or any other that ſhall partake with him.</p>
            <p>The Parliament likewiſe, by their Declaration, did endeavour to appeaſe the minds of the people, many of whom were extreamly diſcontented with theſe proceedings, Tumults and Inſurrections being daily feared, ſo that the Parliament, though victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and guarded with a conquering Army, no Forces viſibly appearing againſt them, yet were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in more danger, and every man began to foreſee Slaughter and War, as Mariners obſerve a riſing Tempeſt.</p>

            <p>The Kings party, though conquered, had great hopes of retrieving their Cauſe, and the ſame thing ſeemed to be the wiſh of many of thoſe called Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians, out of their ſtrong averſion to the Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents; ſo that the King, though ſet aſide, and confined within the Iſle of Wight, was more formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble this Summer than in any other, when he was followed by his ſtrongeſt Armies. The Name of King had now a farther operation, and the pity of the vulgar gave a greater Majeſty to his perſon: Prince Charles alſo by his abſence, and the Name of baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, was more deſired of them, and by his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions, privately ſent from his Father, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands under his Name, he was able to raiſe not only Tumults but Wars.</p>
            <p>The Parliament for their ſecurity, Quartered part of the Army about Weſtminſter, the Mewſe, and other places of the City, and ſome Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons were choſen out of the Houſe, and called A Committee of Safety, and ſate at Derby-Houſe, with power to ſuppreſs Tumults and Inſurrections, and to raiſe Forces upon occaſion; which were the Earls of Northumberland, Kent, Warwick and Mancheſter, the Lords Say, Wharton and Roberts, and thirteen of the H. of Commons, among whom was Lieutenant-General Cromwel: And it was not long e're they had occaſion to make uſe of their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, for upon Sunday; April 9 1648. ſome Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentices, and other looſe people, playing in Moor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fields, ſet upon a Company of the Trained Bands, and with ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In the morning, Fairfax ſent part of his Army into the City, who drove them into Leaden-Hall, taking ſome priſoners, and ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the reſt, ſo that this Tumult was inſtantly ſuppreſs'd, for which ſervice he had the thanks of the Parliament, and ſome of the principal Citizens, and a thouſand pound gratuity to his Souldiers.</p>
            <p>May 26. about three hundred came out of Surry to Weſtminſter, with a Petition to the Parliament, wherein they demand, <q>That the King ſhould be preſently reſtored to his former Dignity, and come to Weſtminſter with honour, freedom, and ſafety, to treat perſonally there about all Controverſies: That the Army ſhould preſently be Disbanded, and the free people of England be governed by their known L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ll the Parliament could debate it, but ſet upon the Souldiers that guarded the Houſe; of whom, ſome they hurt, and killed one. Whereupon, ſome Horſe and Foot were ſent from the Mewſe, who gave them a feeling anſwer, killing ſome, and ſcattering the reſt, ſo that they were utterly vanquiſhed. At the ſame time the Kentiſh-men were coming with a Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and a formidable Army to back it, being inra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged at the death of their Companions, who raiſed a Tumult at Canterbury; to prevent their arrival, Gen. Fairſax was ſent with ſeven Regiments to Black-Heath.</p>
            <p>In the mean time ſome ſmall Inſurrections happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Suffolk, at Stamford, and in Cornwall, but
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:57818:19"/>were ſoon ſuppreſs'd by Coll. Wait, Sir Hardrefs Waller, and others. Sir Thomas Glemham had ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed upon Carliſle, and Sir Marmaduke Langdale up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Berwick, and fortified it, and the Royaliſts had taken the ſtrong Caſtle of Pomfret. To manage theſe Wars in the North, Coll. Lambert was left with ſome Regiments of Fairfaxes Army, but the moſt formidable danger ſeemed to be in Wales, where Poyer, Powel and Langhorn, three Parliament Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels, had raiſed an Army of eight thouſand men, by a Commiſſion from Prince Charles, but Collonel Horton, with three thouſand ingaged them near Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſtone, and totally routed, and put to flight their whole Army. A great ſlaughter was made, and about three thouſand priſoners taken, equal to the number of the Victors; among whom were one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty Officers, many Colours, a great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Arms, with all their Cannon, Langhorn and Powel eſcaped with Poyer into Pembrook-caſtle. Cromwel himſelf, about the beginning of May, was ſent into Wales with ſome Regiments, who coming to Chepſtow-caſtle, reſolved to beſiege it, but haſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Pembroke, he left Coll. Ewer at Chepſtow, who within fifteen days took that Caſtle, and klled Kemiſh, to whom the Governour had treacherouſly ſurrendred it.</p>
            <p>May 20. Cromwel came to Pembrook, of which Collonel Poyer was Commander, who relying on the great ſtrength of the place, refuſed all conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, being ſenſible that time was very precious with the Parliament, who were ſurrounded with ſo many difficulties at once; but Cromwel, to whom deſpair was altogether a ſtranger, prepared for the Siege, being much furthered in his work from the Sea, by the great Induſtry of Sir George Ayſcough, who continually furniſh'd him, by the aſſiſtance of a Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron of Ships, with great Guns and Proviſions of all ſorts from Briſtol. Having taken a full ſurvey of the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:57818:19"/>ſtrength of the Caſtle, he reſolves to batter it with his Cannon, becauſe he had notice their Powder and other proviſions would ſoon be ſpent, and that the diviſions he heard were among them, might occaſion them to yield, and ſo ſave the loſs of his men, of whom he was very careful, ſince ſo much Work lay upon their hands: In the mean time he ſtrictly guarded the Trenches, to prevent them from coming out, which had the effect he expected; Hunger, if not breaking through ſtone Walls, yet occaſioning them to deliver up the Town and Caſtle, the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers upon Quarter, but Langhorn, Poyer, Powel, and ſome others, upon mercy, which the reſt found, but Poyer was ſhot to death.</p>
            <p>While Cromwel was acting theſe things in Wales, Fairfax, with his ſeven Regiments, marched from Black-Heath toward Rocheſter, and about Graveſend a great number were got together, and among them above twenty Knights, Eſquires and Gentlemen, of the County, with ſeveral of the Kings old Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, but they durſt not ingage Fairfax, though more numerous, ſome marching to Maidſtone, a few to Rocheſter, others to Dover, to beſiege that Caſtle, but were ſoon removed by Coll. Rich, and Sir Mich. Liveſey. About two thouſand were got to Maidſtone, and reſolved to defend it, which they did with ſuch obſtinacy, that the valour of Fairfax and his Souldiers were never tryed ſo much before, nor a Victory got with greater danger; for after they had broke into the Town with much difficulty, they found a War in every Street, and Cannon plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt them, ſo that they were forced to fight for every corner of it, but at length, with the loſs of forty men, it was taken, two hundred of the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aliſts being ſlain, and fourteen hundred made priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, four hundred Horſe, and two thouſand Arms ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; and it was remarkable, that at the ſame time another Army of many thouſand Kentiſh-men, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:57818:20"/>from Rocheſter to aid their Friends, yet when they came near durſt not aſſiſt them, but ſtood in ſight while Fairfax took the Town. Kent ſeemed now to be quiet, when the Lord Goring, with the remains of the Kentiſh-men, being about two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, marched as far as Greenwich, ſending to ſee how the Citizens ſtood affected to the buſineſs, but while he ſtaid, expecting an anſwer, ſome Troops of the Army came in ſight, upon which Goring and all his company fled, the Horſemen perſuing took ſome Booty, and the Kentiſh-men generally went home to their own Houſes, but the Lord Goring, with about five hundred Horſe, coming to Greenwich, they got Boats, and paſſed over into Eſſex, and the Lord Capel, with Forces out of Hartford-ſhire, and Sir Charles Lucas, with a body of Horſe, joined him at Chelmsford, with ſeveral of the Kings Souldiers, and many Londoners who flock'd to them. The General followed them, croſſing the Thames at Graveſend, and at length drove them into Colcheſter, where after near three months Siege, being reduced to that extremity as to live ſeveral VVeeks upon Horſe-fleſh; deſpairing of relief, they at length yielded themſelves priſoners, Sir Charles Lucas, and Sir George Liſle, being ſhot to death.</p>
            <p>At this time Cromwel marches Northward, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to prevent the danger from Scotland, from whence D. Hamilton was marching with a potent Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. Lambert was ſent before to ſuppreſs Glemham and Langdale, who with their Forces being about three thouſand, retired into Cumberland and Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moreland, expecting to join with the Seets, which they did, and fell upon Lambert at Appleby, forcing him to retire out of the Town, but Cromwel having received all neceſſary ſupplies from the Parliament, came and joined him, and obſerved the motions of D. Hamilton, being both but eight thouſand ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred men, againſt the Scots and Engliſh Army of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:57818:20"/>twenty one thouſand, who were marched into Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land as far as Preſton in Lancaſhire, where Cromwel reſolved to fight them, his forlorn ingaging them firſt with two hundred Horſe and four hundred Foot, and he himſelf leading up the main body in the beſt poſture the place would admit, being a dirty lane, and inconvenient for Horſe, where after four hours diſpute, he put them to the rout, whom the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querours perſued through Preſton, and having clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Streets, followed them as far as Warrington, about twenty miles, killing many in the chaſe, and taking Lieutenant-General Baily priſoner, with the greateſt part of the Scots Army, granting them only Quarter for their Lives. Three thouſand Scots were ſlain, and ten thouſand taken priſoners, with above one hundred colours, and all their Baggage. Duke Hamilton finding the ſervice too warm, retreats over the Bridge with a good party of Horſe and Foot, but Cromwel ordered his men to fall in among them pell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mell, with their ſwords drawn, at which deſperate courage the Scots being amazed, betook themſelves to flight, and the Duke with a body of Horſe got to Utox<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>r, where he was taken priſoner by the Lord Grey, and about three thouſand Horſe with him; Langdale was alſo taken by a Parliament Captain.</p>
            <p>Conſpiracies by land, though over the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, ſeemed not enough, but the Sea likewiſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted from the Parliament; divers of the chief Ships in the Royal Navy, in June 1648. ſet the Vice-Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral Rainsborough aſhoar, declaring they would ſerve the King and P. Charles, now coming from Holland with twenty ſail of Ships, and two thouſand men. The Parliaments Vice-Admiral joined with them, and the D. of York, who had made his eſcape from London, being alſo aboard. At which the Parliament were much diſturbed, and ſent to the E of Warwick to command the remaining Navy, which he readily undertook, but his brother, though
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:57818:21"/>no ſouldier, by commiſſion from the Prince, aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles five hundred Horſe and Foot about Kingſton-Heath, depending on the affections of the Citizens, having with him the D. of Buckingham, his Brother L. Francis Villiers, and the E. of Peterborough, but Sir Michael Liveſey, and others, ſoon diſperſed them. The L. Francis Villiers was ſlain, and the L. Holland flying with the remainder of his Horſe to St. Needs, was altogether ſubdued, Dalbeer, and ſome other Gentlemen ſlain, and himſelf taken pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner. At the ſame time Roſſirer obtained a great Victory over one thouſand Horſe, who were pillaging the Country, out of Pomfret-caſtle.</p>
            <p>About the end of Auguſt, Warwick was with a good Fleet in the River of Thames, when P. Charles with a great Navy of twenty ſtout Men of War came up the River, and commanded him to take down his Flag, and yield Obedience to him as chief Admiral by the Kings Commiſſion. Warwick refuſed, yet declined fighting in that narrow channel, expecting to be joined by the Portſmouth Fleet, commanded by Sir G. Ayſcough, which the Royaliſts reported was revolted alſo; but though moſt of the Mariners were inclined to the Prince, yet Sir George, by his prudent managery, at length confirmed them in their Obedience to the Parliament, and failing by P. Charles in the Night, brought all his Ships ſafe to the E. of Warwick, who now reſolved to ingage the Prince, but finding he was gone back to Holland for want of proviſions, he followed him ſoon after with the whole Fleet to Goree, upon that coaſt.</p>
            <p>Cromwel, after he had given that great defeat to Hamilton, following his Victory, marches toward Scotland to aſſiſt Argyle and Levens, againſt the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Monroe and Lanerick, and to give them an account what was become of Hamilton, but upon his approach, without effecting any thing, they with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw their Forces back into Scotland, and Cromwel
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:57818:21"/>in his way reduced Berwick and Carliſle into the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments power. Before he entred Scotland, he Rendevouz'd his. Army on the banks of the Tweed, and cauſed proclamation to be made at the head of every Regiment, That no man, upon pain of death, ſhould take from the Scots either Cattel or Goods without Order. He then marches directly toward Edinburgh, to conſult about the affairs of both King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms; many of the Scots Nobility and Gentry were ſent from the Committee of Eſtates to meet him, who after congratulatory Orations made, conducted him to Edenburgh, where Argyle, Leven, and other Lords, treated him and the reſt of the Engliſh com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, with a magnificent banquet in the Caſtle. Thanks were given by the Miniſters to Cromwel, who was by them ſtiled, The preſerver of Scotland under God; many of theſe having denounced the wrath of God againſt that Army of Hamilton, which by the ſucceſs they now thought fulfilled. Such alſo was the Teſtimony of the Committee of Eſtates, written to the Engliſh Parliament, concerning Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel. Preſently after the Forces of Monroe and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerick were disbanded, and all others, except fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen hundred Horſe and Foot, under the command of Leven, for ſettling the Kingdom. It was alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed by the Committee of Eſtates, and Aſſembly of the Hirk, for preſervation of Religion, and brotherly love with the Engliſh Nation, <q>That no man who had joined with Hamilton, in the late Invaſion of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, ſhould be choſen for the new Parliament, which was then called, or into the Aſſembly of the Kirk, as being enemies to Religion, and both the Kingdoms.</q>
            </p>
            <p>A ſtrange and ſudden alteration this was, That the Engliſh Army, which but a year before were by the Kirk party of Scotland called a bundle of Sectaries, and reviled by all manner of opprobrious names, ſhould now be acknowledged by the ſame Scots to be
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:57818:22"/>the Inſtruments of God, and Vindicators both of the Church and Kingdom of Scotland. And this great change in the Council of Scotland, had been more to he wondred at, if the change that then happened in the Engliſh Parliament were not much more ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing, for who can imagine that Cromwel, for vanquiſhing a Scotch Army, by which the Nation was delivered from plunder, and many other miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs, ſhould be acknowledged there the preſerver of Scotland, and that the ſame Victory of his againſt the Scots, ſhould pleaſe the Presbyterian Scots for Religion ſake, and for Religions ſake diſpleaſe the Presbyterians in England, for the face of the Engliſh Parliament was now ſuddenly changed, and the Vo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

New ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes are now made to the King, with more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion than ever was before reſolved on; the eleven Impeached Members were reſtored to their ſeats, and the Houſes debated of treating with the King up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his own ſecurity perſonally, at London, with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, freedom and ſafety. But this was not carried, only a Treaty was Vored to be in the Iſle of Wight, and that the King ſhould chuſe the place in that Iſland. In perſnance whereof, the E. of Midd<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

During this Treaty, the King found all kind of reſpect and obſervance from the Commiſſioners, being attended with a Royal Retinue, the D. of Richmond, Marqueſs of Hartford, the Earls of Southampton and Lindſey, with a number of other Gentlemen of Quality who waited in his Train; his own two Chaplains, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of his Lawyers, to adviſe him in the Treaty, being likewiſe allowed him.</p>

               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:57818:22"/>While theſe things were Tranſacting at Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, Cromwel having finiſhed matters in Scotland prepares for his return, and Octob. 16. 1648. leaves Endenburgh, being conducted ſome miles on his way by Argyle, and other Scotch Noblemen, who took their leaves with mutual demonſtrations of kindneſs, and marching toward Carliſle, when he came into Yorkſhire, he was defired by the Committee to reduce the Caſtles of Scarborough and Pomfret in his way; the laſt of which was defended by Coll. John Maurice with great courage, not by the ſtrength of the place, but the valour of the Defendants: The Garriſon conſiſted of four hundred Foot, and one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and thirty Horſe, but all daring fellows, who daily performed ſome notable Exploit by their ſallies, as one time by ſeizing Sir Arthur Ingram with a Troop of Horſe, and obliging him to pay fifteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds to obtain his liberty. Soon after they took Captain Clayton, and moſt of his Troop, and brought into the Caſtle two hundred head of cattel, and many Horſes, though Sir Hen. Cholmly at that time beleaguered it to keep them in. One morning before day, forty Horſe ſallied out, and ſpeeding to Doncaſter, where Coll. Rainsborough, who had a commiſſion to command the ſiege in chief, then Quartered, three of them went into the Town, and inquired for Coll Rainsboroughs Quarters, to which being directed, they went thither pretending to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver him letters from Lieutenant-General Cromwel; the Collonel little ſuſpecting their buſineſs, conſident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly opens the door to receive the letters, but one of them inſtantly ſtabb'd him to the heart, and though his Forces guarded the Town, yet they got back into the Caſtle at mid-day. To reduce this place, Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel having ſettled the Northern counties, now comes and orders the ſiege to be ſtreightned, leaving a ſtrong party under Lambert, who was come from Scotland, to prevent their ranging abroad, and in a while it was ſurrendred.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:57818:23"/>Cromwel marches up to London, and takes his place in parliament, who in his abſence had recalled their Vote of Non-addreſſes, and were treating with the King at Newport, but while this Treaty proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſome months were ſpent in debates, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions and denials, another ſudden alteration hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, which threw the King from the height of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to the loweſt condition, for ſome fearing they might be in danger if the King were reſtored to his Throne, contrived to take him away quite, while others were as earneſt for re-advancing him, ſo that things were brought to no iſſue before Cromwels re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, who had now the thanks of the Houſe given him by the Speaker, for his prudent conduct of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs in Scotland. At the ſame time ſeveral petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were preſented to the Parliament, and ſome to General Fairfax, That whoever had offended againſt the Common wealth, no perſons excepted, might be brought to ſpeedy Jnſtice, that the ſame fault may have the ſame puniſhment in the perſon of K. or Lord, as in the perſon of the pooreſt Commoner: That ſuch as ſpeak or act on the Kings behalf, till he be acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of ſhedding innocent blood, be proceeded againſt as Traytors, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The firſt petition of this kind was preſented to the parliament, Sept 11. the Title was, <q>To the moſt Honourable the Commons of England aſſembled in Parliament, The humble petition of many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of well-affected men in the Cities of London and Weſtminſter, in the Burrough of Southwark, and the neighbouring Villages Inhabitants.</q> This petition which broke the Ice, was in a month fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by ſeveral others, from divers Counties in England, and from ſeveral Regiments of the Army, as from Oxford, Leiceſter, from many commanders in the Army, from Iretons and Ingolsbys Regiment; the deſign of all being the ſame, <q>That Juſtice might be done on the chief Authors of ſo much Blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:57818:23"/>in England, and that thoſe who had been rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers of this ſecond War, and were now in the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments cuſtody, Hamilton, Holland, Capel, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and the reſt, might be puniſh'd, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the King himſelf, &amp;c.</q> Theſe petitions were daily preſented to the Parliament during the Treaty, and by them laid aſide; but at laſt theſe deſires pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed, eſpecially after the Remonſtrance of Fairfax, Cromwel and the General Council of Officers at St. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans, of Nov. 11. 1648.</p>
            <p>At the ſame time Cromwel ſent Coll. Ewer to the Iſle of Wight, to take the King out of the cuſtody of Coll.

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:57818:24"/>for the King to levy War againſt the Common-wealth, but the Lords deny that the King can commit any Treaſon againſt the Common-wealth, and reject the Ordinance for his Tryal by a new Tribunal, which they had erected to conſiſt of one hundred and fifty Commiſſioners, ſix whereof were of the Lords Houſe, the reſt Officers of the Army, and ſome few Citizens. And the Commons further declare, <q>That the people, under God, are the original of all juſt power, and that the Commons of England being the peoples Repreſentative, have the ſupream Authority, and what they Enact has the force of a Law, though the Houſe of Lords do not conſent thereto.</q> Upon theſe and ſeveral other new political principles, they proceed to Try, Judge, Condemn and Execute the King, before his own palace-gate at White-Hall, Jan. 30. 1648.</p>

            <p>The fatal blow being given, the remainder of the Houſe of Commons, and the Army, made it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that they were not only for cutting off the King, but Kingſhip it ſelf, and thereupon the Houſe Voted, <q>That Kingly Government is unneceſſary bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſome and dangerous, and that whereas ſeveral pretences might be made to the Crown, that any perſon who ſhould proclaim Charles Stewart, Son of the late King, or any other, King of England, ſhould ſuffer as in caſe of High Treaſon.</q> And ſoon after the Houſe of Lords was likewiſe Vored uſeleſs and dangerous, at which the Lords were ſo highly Incenſed, that a Declaration was ſuddenly publiſhed in the Name of all the Peers and Barons of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:57818:24"/>England, againſt the proceedings of the Commons, and in definance of all Votes, Acts and Orders to the contrary, Charles the ſecond was proclaimed King, in the Name of all the Nobility, Gentry and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monalty of the Kingdom; but they ſtill proceed, aſſuming new Enſigns of Soveraignty, and cancelling the old, cauſing all Writs, Commiſſions, &amp;c. to iſſue out under a new ſtyle and title, that is, The Keepers of the Liberties of England by the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of parliament, cauſing the old Great Seal to be broken, and a new one made with this Inſcription, In the fifth year of freedom, by Gods bleſſing reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.

Theſe now had the Name of Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers given them, and one Lockier was afterward ſhot to death for promoting a paper, called, The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement and Agreement of the people, &amp;c. in St. Pauls Church-yard, and his Funeral was attended by above one thouſand of the Lilburnian Faction, all wearing black and Sea-green Ribbons, the Army be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now in a violent ferment, and even ready to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy one another, which humour was cheriſhed by John Lilburn, not without incouragement from the Royal party, who from their diviſions hoped to reap advantage.</p>
            <p>In perſuance hereof, Collonel Scroops Regiment of Horſe diſmiſſed their Officers at Salisbury, and with colours flying marched to join Harriſons, Iretons and Skippons Regiments, who by the contrivance of the Agitators, were all ingaged in the ſame deſigns. This defection ſeeming of very dangerous conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, Gen. Fairfax and Cromwel, with his own Regiment, marched to Alton, and had advice the Mutineers were gone to Abington, after whom Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel made ſuch haſte, that in one day he marched forty miles, and having met with them, he politickly propoſed a Treaty before Harriſons Regiment ſhould join them, wherein all parties ſhould receive ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, and that neither of them ſhould keep at ten miles diſtance; upon which, the Levellers went to Burford, and being oppoſed by the Souldiery at New-bridge, to prevent Quarrels they went a little
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:57818:25"/>lower, not doubting but they ſhould all join upon Treaty, and then put moſt of their Horſes to graſs, they being in all above nine hundred, conſiſting of twelve Troops entire, of the beſt in the Army, and leaving a guard of about ſixty men, ſome of their companions, who were brought over to Cromwel, giving Intelligence of their poſture, Coll.

This proved the utter ſuppreſſion of that Faction, and rendred the Army wholly at the devotion of Cromwel.</p>
            <p>About this time another illegal High Court of Juſtice was erected, wherein Duke Hamilton, the Earl of Holland, Lord Capel, and Lord Goring, were brought to their Trial, the three firſt were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned and beheaded at the Palace-yard in Weſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ommon Hall, who attended with ſeveral other Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermen of the ſame temper, readily proclaimed the Edicts of this new Republick in ſeveral places in the City.</p>
            <p>England being thus ſubjected to the power of the Houſe of Commons and the Army, and Scotland not yet ripe for Invaſion, and the Nation full of Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:57818:26"/>who having for ſo long a time led a Military, life, could hardly be reduced to their former Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments: Our new States-men, to prevent any ill humours that might gather among them, reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to make them ſerviceable to their Country in the reduction of Ireland, all that Kingdom, except Dublin and London-derry, being in poſſeſſion of the Iriſh, which neither were able to hold out without ſpeedy aſſiſtance from England. This Rebellion, the moſt barbarous and bloody that ever happened upon earth, acted by Devils in humane ſhape, rather than men, butchering two hundred thouſand prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants in eight weeks ſpace, without the leaſt offence or provocation given, or without ſparing of age or ſex, was perpetrated Oct. 23. 1641. and though contrived ſo ſecretly, and acted ſo furiouſly, yet was Dublin wonderfully preſerved to be a refuge to thoſe poor proteſtants who eſcaped the rage of their bloody perſecutors. Many of them fled to England, but found little relief, for here all things ſeemed to forebode the re-acting the ſame Tragedy, yet in the midſt of the differences between the King and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, it was agreed to ſend ſome Regiments thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if poſſible, to hinder the progreſs of thoſe Aſſaſſines; but this relief was ſo ſmall that it had no effect, for the King finding the parliament prevail againſt him, recalled thoſe Troops from Ireland, many of the Rebels coming along with them to his aſſiſtance, ſo that this Kingdom lay more expoſed to theſe bloody Wolves than ever, and thus they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued for ſome years.</p>
            <p>But this new ſtate having renounced Monarchy and Epiſcopacy, reſolve now to uſe the ſame In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments to recover Ireland, and to that end they ordered an Army to be ſent thither. The Marqueſs of Ormond was made Lord-Lieutenant by the late King, and the Rebels had made a confederacy among themſelves, and upon condition to have the free Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:57818:26"/>of their Religion, and divers other ample pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges and advantages, which the neceſſity of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs obliged him to yield to, they joined their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to his, being alſo aſſiſted by a conſiderable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of others, raiſed by the Earls of Caſtlehaven, Clan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ickand, and the Lord Inchiquin, ſo that they were the greateſt united ſtrength in that Kingdom; but the confederates having broken their Articles with the Lieutenant, and being ready to beſiege Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin, which he was not able to defend, rather than it ſhould fall into the hands of the Iriſh papiſts, he ſurrendred it to Collonel Jones for the parliament, and came over to the King, who was then carried from one place to another by the Army, and from thence he went over to Prince Charles then at Paris. But the Confederates, ſurprized at the great preparations made againſt them in England, ſent Letters to the Prince, humbly intreating him to ſend back the Marqueſs of Ormond, with an abſolute promiſe to ſubmit entirely to the Kings Authority, and to obey his Lieutenant. At their requeſt, he returned into Ireland about a year before Cromwel came over, and with their united Forces they had reduced the whole Country, except London-derry, commanded by Sir Charles Coot, and Dublin, the principal City, wherein was Collonel Jones with no great ſtrength, and who was very jealous of the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity of his own men, that often deſerted and went over to the other party.</p>
            <p>The Iriſh confederates, with an Army of twenty two thouſand men, lay under the very Walls of Dublin, and ſent divers threatning ſummons into it, requiring a ſpeedy ſurrender, but they had no ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect upon the valiant Governour Jones, who yet not inſenſible of the great danger he was in, ſent many earneſt Meſſages to the parliament of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land to aid him with all ſpeed, with Men and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition, or elſe all would be quickly loſt, and
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:57818:27"/>they knowing the difficulties of his condition, haſten their aſſiſtance to him, gave order for ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thither Iretons, Scroops, Hortons, and Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berts Regiments of Horſe, with Hewſons, Deans, Ewers, and Cooks Regiments of Foot, and five Troops of Dragoons, all old tried Souldiers, that feared no Enemy, and led by victorious commanders, with ſome other Regiments new liſted, to make a number ſufficient to effect the buſineſs. Nothing was now wanting but a General to command this gallant Army, which the parliament being ſenſible of Cromwels conduct and fitneſs, deſired him to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, which he readily did, declaring at the ſame time, <q>That he did not doubt but God would uſe him as an Inſtrument to execute his vengeance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the bloody Iriſh;</q> with which anſwer the parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were ſo pleaſed, that inſtantly they give him a commiſſion to be General of all their Forces, and Lord Governour both in the Civil and Military af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of Ireland, and Collonel Jones was made Lieutenant-General of the Horſe. After which, they march to their Rendevouz at Milford in Wales, and July 10. 1649. Cromwel ſet forward from London in a Coach and ſix Horſes, attended with many of the Houſe of commons, council of State, and principal Officers of the Army, with a Life-Guard of fourſcore who had been lately com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, very gallantly accoutred. In this ſtate he march'd to Brainford, where theſe Gentlemen took their leaves, with wiſhes for his happy ſucceſs; from thence he rides poſt to Briſtol, to put his men and Train of Artillery into the Tranſport-ſhips, and afterwards goes into Wales, having ſent Reynolds Regiment of Horſe, and Venables, and Monks Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Foot before from Cheſter, who with a fair wind ſoon arrived at Dublin, to the great joy of the Inhabitants, being about three thouſand in all, who were very careful to recover them from the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigues
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:57818:27"/>of the Sea, in hopes by their means to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their Liberties.</p>
            <p>And in this they found themſelves not miſtaken, for Collonel Jones, much animated with theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruits, reſolved to attack the beſiegers with the firſt opportunity, and accordingly, Aug. 2, when the Iriſh, with a ſtrong party of Horſe and Foot, marched with much aſſurance to Baggor-field, a little way Eaſtward from the city, toward the Sea, from whence they deſigned to run their Trenches to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Works of the city, to prevent the landing any more ſupplies from England, the beſieged ſound a neceſſity to prevent them, and with twelve hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Horſe, and four thouſand Foot, fell upon the Enemies new Works, and rout their Horſe at the firſt encounter, moſt of the Foot being alſo either kill'd or ſlain, conſiſting of fifteen hundred, beſides their Horſe, which ſo incouraged the Engliſh, that they purſued their victory to Rathunines, where the Marqueſs of Ormond with his whole Army of nineteen thouſand men were Incamped, who hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, wiſhed they would come, that he might have ſome ſport with them; he ſoon had his wiſh, but the ſport was ſomewhat rude, for in a ſhort time his Army was utterly put to the rout, four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand being ſlain upon the ſpot, and in the purſuit; and two thouſand five hundred and ſeventeen pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, moſt perſons of Quality, with the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſes own brother, all their Cannon and Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, with a wealthy Camp, became the reward of the conquering Souldiers, who made themſelves Gentlemen with the ſpoils of the vanquiſhed. It is remarkable, that not above twenty of the Engliſh were ſlain in this great action. The Marqueſs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving all was loſt, fled with a conſiderable party to Kilkenny, and from thence to Drogheda, whither Collonel Jones, with ſome Horſe, was marched with all ſpeed, in hopes that the news of this defeat
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:57818:28"/>might cauſe them to ſurrender, but when he heard that Ormond, with three hundred Horſe, was come to re-inforce it, he went back, while the Marqueſs fortifies Dundalk, Trim, and ſome other places ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent to Tredagh, hoping to preſerve what he had by the ſtrength of his Troops, and to have an Army of Foot ready before Cromwels arrival: But he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Intelligence of this great Victory, being then at Milford-Haven in Wales, he inſtantly ſailed thence with the Van of his Army in thirty two Tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, and Ireton with the main body in forty two more; Hugh Peters with about twenty ſail following them, and having a fair wind, they all ſoon arrived at Dublin, and were received with all ſigns of joy and ſatisfaction, and eſpecially the new Lord Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour Cromwel, whom the people crowded to behold, and who obſerving their zeal and kindneſs, putting off his Hat, he ſpake to them to this effect, <q>That as God had brought him thither in ſafety, ſo he doubted not, but by the divine aſſiſtance, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore them to all their juſt Rights, Liberties and Properties, and that all thoſe whoſe hearts and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections were real for carrying on the great work, againſt the barbarous and blood-thirſty Iriſh and their adherents and confederates, and that were for prepagating the Goſpel of Chriſt, the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing of truth and peace, and reſtoring this bleeding Narion to its former happineſs and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility, ſhould find favour and protection from the Parliament of England and himſelf, and ſhould likewiſe receive ſuch endowments and gratuities as were ſeitable to their meries.</q> This ſpeech was received with the approbation and acclamations of the people, many of whom declared, That they would live and dye with him.</p>
            <p>The Army being all landed and refreſhed, Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel publiſhes a proclamation againſt ſwearing, cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and drunkenneſs, under the moſt ſevere penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:57818:28"/>and having ſettled matters in Dublin, he muſters his Army, which then conſiſted of fifteen thouſand Horſe and Foot well accoutred, out of whom he made a detachment of about ten thouſand, with whom, and a ſine Train of Artillery, Ammunition and proviſions, he marches to Drogheda, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by Sir Arthur Aſhton, formerly Governour of Reading and Oxford, and an expert and valiant ſouldier, the Garriſon conſiſting in about three thouſand Horſe and Foot, moſt Engliſh. After ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moning the Town, which was ſlighted, Cromwel prepares all neceſſaries to beſiege it, Sir G. Ayſcough and his ſquadron in the mean time blocking it up by Sea, and the white flag was taken down, the red de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing blood and deſtruction being diſplayed in its ſtead, which yet did not much diſcourage the beſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, who expected relief from Ormond, and had likewiſe abſolutely determined among themſelves to conquer or dye, which they did quickly after; for Cromwel without making Trenches or Ditches, rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a ſtrong battery of Cannon againſt it, which ſoon beat down a Church-ſteepie and a Tower, on the South of the Town, and upon throwing two or three hundred Balls more, the corner Tower between the South-eaſt Wall was levelled, and ſuch a breach made, that three Regiments of Foot entred, it not being large enough for the Horſe, but met with ſuch ſurious oppoſition from the beſieged, that they forced them back faſter than they came on, which Cromwel obſerving from the battery, he with a freſh ſupply of Collonel Ewers Foot, enters in perſon into the Town, whoſe preſence ſo incouraged the ſouldiers, that nothing was able to ſtand before them, ſo that having ſecured the Town, to revenge their late re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe, they cut off all they met with, yet Aſhtons ſouldiers deſperately oppoſed them at every corner, and when not able to defend the ſtreets, retreated to the Churches-ſteeples, and other ſecurities, but the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:57818:29"/>aſſailants perſued them with utmoſt rage, and with Gun-powder blew up an hundred of them who were got into St. Peters ſteeple, only one eſcaping, who by the fall broke his leg, and had Quarter given him. Others refuſed to yield upon ſummons, and were thereupon kept ſo long from Victuals, that they were forced to ſurrender; after which, moſt of the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, with every tenth ſouldier, was put to the Sword, and the reſt ſent to Barbadoes, Sir Arthur Aſhton being ſlain among the reſt, Cromwel by theſe ſevere executions deſigning to terrify other places from making any oppoſition, which had ſuch effect, that in a ſhort time he wholly conquered the Kingdom. And thus was this ſtrong Garriſon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced and plundered in ſeven days, which the Iriſh were three years e're they could take.</p>
            <p>Dundalk and Trim expecting no better Quarter, the Souldiers deſerted them with ſuch precipitation, that they left all their cannon behind: In the laſt, fixed upon their carriages; and the Engliſh revolted ſo faſt to the conqueror, that Ormonds Forces increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed very little, ſo that he durſt not ingage Cromwel, but endeavoured to hinder them from having provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. Upon which, the General reſolved to march Weſtward, and aſſault Wexford, putting a Garriſon into Killingkerrick near Dublin, which had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted by the Enemy, together with Arkloe-caſtle, one of the ſeats of the Family of Ormond, and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other ſmall places which ſurrendred to him; at length he came before Wexford, and ſummoned it, but the Governour Collonel Synno<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> politickly treated about terms, till he was re-inforced with five hundred Foot, under the Earl of Caſtlehaven, and then ſeem'd to defie any attack: Whereupon, Cromwel preſently plants a battery againſt the caſtle at the South-eaſt end of the Town, as being of great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence to the gaining it, and had not plaid long upon it, before the Governour ſurrenders it, of
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:57818:29"/>which the ſouldiers having poſſeſſion; and ſhewing themſelves to the Town, affrighted them from the Walls, which they ſoon perceiving, in an inſtant ſcaled the Walls without much reſiſtance, and entring into the Town, cut off all that were in Arms, till they came to the Market-place, where the enemy made a ſtand, and fought it out to the laſt, but at length were ſubdued, and all in Arms put to the Sword.</p>
            <p>This Sea-port being taken, which was convenient for ſupplies, the Victors march to Roſs, another Sea Town, conſiderable for ſtrength and trade, and ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate on the River Barrow, where a Ship of ſeven or eight hundred Tun might ride by the Wall; the Lords of Ormond, Caſtlehaven and Ards were there in perſon, having brought fifteen hundred men in Boats to re-inforce it, in ſight of the Engliſh, who could not prevent it: Cromwel ſummons the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour M. General Twaff to a rendition, by aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him, <q>That ſince his coming into Ireland, he ever avoided the effuſion of Blood, having been before no place where he did not firſt ſend them ſuch Terms as might have preſerved them, and that upon the ſame account he required him to ſurrender the Town to the parliament of England.</q> He received no return, till a battery of ſix or ſeven great cannon, which played furiouſly upon the Town, mollified the Governour, ſo that to prevent the danger other places had incurred, he delivered it up upon condition to march away with bag and baggage to Kilkenny, which fifteen hundred of them did, but ſix hundred being Engliſh, joined with Cromwel. At which time Bandon-bridge, Youghal, Cork, Kinſale, and other Garriſons, freely declared for the parliament; and in the North Sir Charles Coot, and Collonel Venables, ſucceeded as well, and ſo did L. Broghill, and Collonel Hewſon in other parts.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:57818:30"/>Cromwel having taken Roſs, by a bridge of boats over the River marched his men to beſiege Dungan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, a ſtrong Fort commanded by Coll. Wogan, but having little hope of reducing it quickly, they riſe and march to Kilkenny, where the Marqueſs of Ormond and L. Inchiqueen declare they would fight him, being much ſtronger than Cromwel, yet upon his approach retreated without action; whereupon Eniſteoge and Carrick were taken without loſs of a man, and the General marches to Waterford (taking Paſſage-Fort by the way) hoping to reduce it before Winter, but it being December, and very wet, the Souldiers were put into Wiater-Quarters till the Spring. During which, the Iriſh attempted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain Paſſage Fort, by a party from Water o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

At this time Lieutenant General Jones dyed of a violent Fever at Dungannon, and though it were Winter, yet Cromwel viſited all the Garriſons in Munſter, and received great Recruits from England, many of his Souldiers and Officers dying by ſickneſs, and put a new Mayor into Kinſale, the former being an Iriſh papiſt.

Cromwel next proceeds to the ſiege of Kilkenny, which was full of Officers and Souldiers from other places, and the Governour Sir Walter Butler refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to ſurrender, the Lord Governour cauſed the cannon to play, which had not thrown one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ſhot e're a breach was made, and Collonel Ewers with a thouſand Foot, though at firſt repul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, gained the Iriſh Town, and the Suburbs on the other ſide the River, which cauſed the Governour to Treat upon Terms, ſince he could not hope for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief; and the Garriſon in Cautnell-caſtle, whom he had ſent to aſſiſt him, deſired paſſes of Cromwel to go beyond Sea, ſo that the capitulation was quickly finiſhed, and that conſiderable City of Kilkenny, which had been the ſeat of the ſupream council, was reduced in ſix days time.</p>
            <p>The Marqueſs of Ormond, and other chief com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:57818:31"/>obſerving the unſuccesfulneſs of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, conſulted with the Gentlemen of Weſtmeath at Baltemore, how to manage their affairs with more advantage for the future, but finding their own Ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, ſome were for an accommodation with the Engliſh, but others doubting whether they might obtain pardon or good terms, it was concluded to do the greateſt miſchief they could to the Engliſh in their Quarters, till they had opportunity to eſcape out of the country.</p>
            <p>Cromwel after this beſieges Clonmell, a ſtrong Garriſon, wherein were one handred and twenty Horſe, and two thouſand Foot: During which, coll. Reynolds and Hewſon beſiege Trim, and the Lord Broghill defeats the Biſhop of Roſs, who with five thouſand deſigned to relieve Clonmell, killing ſeven hundred, taking twenty Officers, and the Biſhop himſelf, with the Standard of the church of Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and carrying him to a caſtle defended by the Biſhops Forces, hangs him before the. Walls in their fight, which ſo terrified them that they ſoon ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred. Theſe ſucceſſes incouraged the beſiegers of Clonmell, wherein were many gallant ſoaldiers and commanders, and great unanimity; but Cromwel to loſe no more time, preſently batters it with his can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, which opened a breach whereat the ſouldiers enter, but were repulſed with the utmoſt fury, ſo that the fucceſs was doubtful for four hours, and a great carnage made, till at length the Iriſh are forced to quit the place, and betake themſelves to flight, whom the victorious ſouldiers perſued with revenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful minds, and made a dreadful ſlaughter. Thus was this conſiderable place reduced, though with greater loſs than ordinary to the Engliſh, wherein they found the ſtouteſt enemy they ever met in Ireland.</p>
            <p>Cromwel having thus in ten months time, perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more than any Prince before was able to do in
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:57818:31"/>ten years, in ſubduing an obſtinate bloody enemy that deſpaired of pardon, and therefore fought with the greater animoſity; and there now remaining unreduced only Lymerick, Waterford, and ſome few other inconſiderable Garriſons, to which ſervice Ireton was appointed, whom the Lord Governour made Lord Deputy. He takes his leave of Ireland, and after a ſtormy paſſage lands at Briſtol, where he was received with acclamations, and the diſcharging of the cannon, and haſtens from thence to London, being met at Hounſlow by General Fairfax, ſeveral Members of parliament, and Officers of the Army, with multitudes of ſpectators, who came to ſee him of whom they had heard ſuch great matters; where after mutual ſalutations and congratulations he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds, and is ſaluted near Hyde-park with ſome Field-peces, and Volleys of ſmall ſhot, by Collonel Barkſteads Regiment, drawn up in the High-way for that purpoſe, and after conducted to the Cock-pit near St. James's, prepared for his reception, where he is viſited by the Lord Mayor and Aldermen of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and other perſons of Quality, all expreſſing the ſence of their obligations. Soon after he took his place in parliament, and received the thanks of the Houſe from the Speaker, and then gave them a full account of the preſent condition of Ireland.</p>
            <p>At this time Virginia, and the Caribbee Iſlands, revolt from the parliament, and cry up the Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy and Liturgy, who thereupon prohibit all Nations to Trade with them, and in a few months they are wholly ſubdued by a Fleet ſent thither under Sir G. Ayſcough. Prince Rupert infeſts the Engliſh Coaſts from Scilly, Jerſey, Ireland and France, with the States revolted Ships, to the great loſs of the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, whereupon a Fleet well equipt is ſet forth againſt him, who block him up in Kinſale, which Town being taken by Cromwel, they were forced to haſten away, leaving three Ships behind, and ſailed
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:57818:32"/>to Lisbon, where they were protected by the King of Portugal, which cauſed a difference between that King and the Engliſh Republick. About the ſame time, that is, May 3. 1649. Dr. Doriſlaus, who drew up the charge againſt King Charle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But the greateſt danger to this new Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, though victorious in Ireland, ſeemed to be from Scotland, for King Charles II. being in the Iſle of Jerſey, and having notice of the great facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and differences in that Kingdom, between the Covenanters and the Royaliſts, he gives a commiſſion to the Marqueſs of Montroſs (who in the year 1645. was ſo ſucceſsful for a time, that the whole Kingdom of Scotland may be ſaid to have been won and loſt in one month) by which commiſſion he was to raiſe Forces in Holland, and other parts, wherewith, if poſſible, to abate the power of the Covenanters, ſo that the King might be able to treat with them upon better terms. He accordingly, in a ſhort time, ſends ſome Forces into the Iſles of Orkney, and a few more under Sir James Mongo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mery, to the North of Scotland. Theſe the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of Eſtates reſolve to oppoſe, though raiſed for the Kings ſervice, and ſend propoſitions to him to Jerſey, which being granted, they would enter into a Treaty to reſtore him to that Kingdom; the ſubſtance whereof were, <q>That he would ſign the ſolemn league and covenant, and oblige all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to take it: To confirm all Acts of parliament in the two laſt Seſſions, and to have no Negative
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:57818:32"/>voice in their parliament, and would appoint ſome place about Holland to treat in.</q> The King con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, and promiſed in the word of a Prince, to perform them, and Breda, a Town in Holland, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Prince of Orange, was the place appointed, where the Scots Commiſſioners meet him, and the Treaty in a ſhort time was fully concluded, wherein one Article was, <q>That the Marqueſs of Montroſs, and his adherents, be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited acceſs into that Kingdom.</q> During this Treaty, Montroſs being commiſſioned by the King, fearing he ſhould have an expreſs command to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, and himſelf be baniſh'd his country, landed as you heard at Orkney, and in the North, with ſome inconſiderable ſupplies of men and money, againſt whom the parliament, then ſitting, ſend an Army of ſeven thouſand Foot, and three Troops of Horſe, who utterly defeat his Forces, which were only twelve hundred, of whom two hundred were ſlain, and all the reſt taken except one hundred, who made their eſcape; and Montroſs himſelf, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing three or four days in the open Fields with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out meat or drink, with only one man, diſcovered himſelf to the L.

The King was ſomewhat ſtartled at theſe proceedings, but the Scots Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners deſired him nor to ſtumble at theſe matters, ſince they were all deſigned to promote his Intereſts; ſo that finding it could not be redreſſed, he was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to conceal his reſentments, and the Treaty being finiſhed, the King prepared for his Voyage to Scotland.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:57818:33"/>The parliament of England having exact Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of all theſe proceedings, it was debated whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the War which was inevitable between them and the Scots, ſhould be Offenſive or Defenſive; at length, being ſenſible what deſolations they brought along with them when they came in as Friends, and afterwards as Enemies in Duke Hamiltons Invaſion, it was concluded to make Scotland the ſeat of the War, and accordingly they Order the Army to march Northward, but General Fairfax, as well as ſome others, being diſſatisfied about the obligation of the National Covenant entred into between both King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, which he conceived would not permit us to make War on Scotland, deſired to be excuſed, and delivered up his commiſſion, which at firſt was a little ſtartling, but the parliament ſoon found ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther General, of whoſe valour and conduct they had large experience, which was Cromwel, who accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the charge, and had a commiſſion to be Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of all the Forces that now were, or hereafter ſhould be raiſed by the Common-wealth of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and all commiſſions formerly granted to Sir Tho. Fairfax were made void.</p>
            <p>June 28. 1650. Cromwel with his Army marched toward Scotland, and was received at York by the Lord Mayor and Aldermen with great reſpect: The report of his coming, ſurprized the Committee of Eſtates, who ſent a Letter to the Parliament, <q>That they admired the Engliſh ſhould advance toward them, and that many of their Ships were ſeized contrary to the Act of pacification, which allowed three months warning, and that the Forces they had raiſed, were only in their own defence, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firing to know whether thoſe of the Engliſh were deſigned to guard their own borders, or to invade Scotland.</q> The parliament by their Declaration declare the reaſons of their proceeding, and among others, <q>That the Scots endeavour to ſeduce the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:57818:33"/>people of the Common-wealth of England from their affection and duty to the parliament, and to promote the latereſt of the late King under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the Covenant, and though they could claim no authority or dominion over us, yet in Scotland they proclaimed Charles Stewart to be King of England and Ireland, and ſince that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to aſſiſt him againſt the Common-wealth; and had declared againſt the Engliſh parliament and Army, ranking them with malignants and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts. Theſe with many others, were ſuch into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable provocations, and no ſatisfaction being to be had but by the ſword, the parliament reſolve to vindicate the Nations honour, and to ſecure it from the like Inſolencies for the future.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Army likewiſe publiſh a Declaration, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in taking notice of the practices of ſome in that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, who endeavour by unjuſt reproaches and falſe ſlanders, to make the Army odious, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them rather monſters than men, they to clear themſelves, deſire them to remember what their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour was when they were there before, or what wrong or injury was then done either to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, Goods or Houſes of any, and therefore they had no reaſon by falſe reports to affright the people from their Habitations: Further, aſſuring all perſons who were not active againſt the parliament, that they ſhould not have the leaſt injary done them, either in Body or Goods, but upon complaint ſhould have preſent redreſs, and that they might ſecure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly continue in their Habitations.</p>
            <p>Copies of theſe Declarations were given to the country people at Berwick-market, and others ſent into Scotland, which afterward had good effect. After which Cromwel marches from York to North-Allerton, and thence to New-caſtle, where he was nobly treated by Sir Arthur Haſlerig the Governor, and after imploring the bleſſing of Heaven, and
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:57818:34"/>having provided for future ſupplies, he poſts to Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick, and July 20. 1650. Rendevouzed his Army upon Hagerſtone-moor, four miles from thence, where appeared a gallant body of Horſe of five thouſand four hundred and fifteen, with valiant Riders to manage them, ten thouſand two hundred forty nine Foot, with a Train of Artillery conſiſting of ſix hundred and ninety. In all ſixteen thouſand three hundred forty five. After which, they were Quartered on the banks of River Tweed.</p>
            <p>In England, John Lilburn about this time was tryed at Guild-hall, a man of a reſtleſs and invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſpirit, who is charged with publiſhing Books, wherein the parliament are termed Tyrants, Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, Conquering Uſurpers, &amp;c. and though it was generally thought they were of his writing and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing, yet he made ſuch a ſubtile defence, that the Jury brought him in Not Guilty, and ſo he was releaſed. Not long after, Collonel Euſebius An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews being found with a commiſſion from King Charles H. was condemned by an High Court of Juſtice, and beheaded at Tower-hill. And one Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, who was condemned with him, was executed at Tyburn. At the ſame time an Inſurrection hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in Norfolk, an Undiſciplin'd company, aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling and roaring about, pretending they deſigned the aboliſhing of popery, the reſtoring the young King to his Crown, and to revenge his Fathers death, and to ſuppreſs Hereſie and Schiſm: But two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Horſe being ſent againſt them from Lyn, and three Troops from the Army, ſoen diſperſed them, twenty of whom of no eminency were hanged. Sir Henry Hyde being ſent Ambaſſador from King Charles the Second, to the Grand Seignior at Conſtantinople, had ſome conceſt with Sir Tho. Bendiſh the parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments Ambaſſador there, whereupon they had a hearing before the Vizier Baſſa, and the reſult was, That Sir Tho. Bendiſh ſhould diſpoſe of Sir Henry
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:57818:34"/>Hyde as he thought fit, who preſently ſent him to Smyrna, and thence to England, where he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, and beheaded before the Royal Exchange in London.</p>
            <p>Prince Rupert and his Fleer lying in the Haven of Lisbon, as you have heard, General Blake came be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the City with the parliaments Fleet, and after having deſtroyed ſeveral French Privateers, and ſome rich Sugar-ſhips of the King of Portugals, he was forced by ſtorm, and to re victual, to go to ſome other Port; upon which, P. Rupert took the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to ſail thence with his Fleet to Malaga, where they burnt and ſpoiled ſeveral Merchants Ships. Whereupon, Blake reduced his Fleet to ſeven ſtout nimble Sailors, ſending the reſt home with the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes, and with theſe ſailed with all ſpeed after Prince Rupert to Malaga, but they being gone to Alicant, he ſtill followed them, taking in his way a French ſhip of twenty Guns, with the Roe-buck, a revolt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhip; and the Black Prince, another of Prince Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perts Fleet, to avoid being taken, ran aſhoar and blew her ſelf up. Next day, four more of the Princes Fleet ran aſhoar at Cartagena, and were caſt away, the reſt making their eſcape, and ſo Blake returned again to England.</p>
            <p>The Scots had now finiſh'd their Treaty with King Charles the Second, he having promiſed to confirm the Presbyterian Government in Scotland for three years, provided that himſelf might have always three Chaplains of his own Election: As alſo to confirm the Militia in the hands of the Eſtates for five years, provided it afterward ſhould return to himſelf. It was now reſolved a Meſſage ſhould be ſent to invite him to make all poſſible ſpeed to his Kingdom of Scotland, though it was oppoſed in the parliament at Edenburgh, and put to the Vote whether any more addreſſes ſhould be made to the King, and thirty two were for the Negative, but the Affirmatives being
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:57818:35"/>the major part, the meſſage was ſent accordingly, with a proteſtation, <q>That they would aſſiſt him with their Lives and Fortunes, to eſtabliſh him in all his Dominions; yet withal, forbore not to adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe him, they had Teſtimonies to produce of his tramactings, by Letters with Montroſs (of which they had intercepted three or four) contrary to his promiſe at Breda, however they were willing to diſpence with him for what was paſſed, ſo that he would, without delay, according to the Articles of agreement, come over into Scotland, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with the Parliament and the Kirk.</q>
            </p>
            <p>After which they prepared for his reception, but prohibited Duke Hamilton, the Earls of Lauderdail and Seaforth, with many other perſons of Quality, who had conſtantly attended him in Jerſey and Holland, from returning into Scotland. About the beginning of June, 1650. he left the Hague, and after a tedious ſtorm, and narrowly eſcaping ſome Engliſh Ships, landed in the North of Scotland, whither ſome Lords were ſent to receive and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany him to Edenburgh, being entertained by the way with the acclamations of the people. At Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dee, new propoſitions from the Parliament and Kirk were ſent him, which with ſome ſeeming reluctancy he ſigned. The Town of Aberdeen preſented him with fifteen hundred pounds, but the Committee of Eſtates ſent to other places that deſigned the like, enjoining them to bring whatever money and plate they had to beſtow, into the Treaſury which they would appoint.</p>
            <p>While they were in expectation of the Kings arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val, the Committee of Eſtates and Parliament con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted about forming an Army for his ſervice as they pretended, and an Act was paſſed for Training every fourth man, capable to bear Arms, throughout the Kingdom, and for raiſing ſixteen thouſand Foot, and ſix thouſand Horſe, the Earl of Leven to be
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:57818:35"/>General of the Foot, Holborn Major-General, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid Leſley Lieutenant-General of the Horſe, and Montgomery Major-General, the ſupream command being reſerved for the King; who arriving at Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh, was complemented with many congratula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and July 15. proclaimed King at the Croſs, and had a ſtrong Guard to attend him and obſerve his motions.</p>
            <p>We left Cromwel and his Army upon the very edge of Scotland, who upon July 22. 1650. drew them forth to a Rendevoz, upon an Hill within Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick bounds, from whence they had an exact view of the bordering parts of Scotland, where they were to act their parts; to whom the General made a ſhort ſpeech, exhorting them to be faithful and couragious, and then they need not doubt the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of Heaven, and incouragement from himſelf: Which they received with ſhouts of approbation. After which he marches into Scotland, quartering in the Field that Night near the Lord Mordingtons<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, where proclamation was made, That none upon pain of death, ſhould offer any violence to the perſons or goods of any in Scotland not in Arms; and no ſouldier ſhould dare to ſtraggle half a mile from the Army without ſpecial licenſe. From hence they marched to Dunbar, where they received ſome proviſions from the Ships, ſent on purpoſe to ſupply them, the people having left their Habitations, and nothing behind them. Thence they came to Hadington, twelve miles from Edenborough, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any oppoſition or ſight of an enemy; next day hearing the Scots would meet them at Gladſmeer, they endeavoured to poſſeſs the Moor before them, but no conſiderable party appeared, whereupon M. Gen. Lambert, and Collonel Whaley, with four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen hundred Horſe, were ſent as a Van-guard to Muſtleborough, to attempt ſomething upon the Scots; and Major Hains, commanding the Forlorn, faced
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:57818:36"/>them in leſs than a mile of their Trenches. Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel, with the reſidue of the Army, drew up before Edenburgh, and ſome skirmiſhes happened about poſſeſſing King Arthurs Hill, within a mile of the City, which the Engliſh gained, and likewiſe a Church, and other Houſes, but the Scots not endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the ſhock, that Night the Engliſh withdrew and lay cloſe Incamped at Muſcleborough, being wearied with conſtant duty and continual rain: The Scots were within four miles of them, Intrench'd within a line which flanked from Edenburgh to Leich, and lay ſo ſtrong, that the Engliſh lay ſtill that day in the rain without covert, but were incouraged with hope of a ſudden Ingagement. Next day the ground being very wet, and proviſions ſcarce, the Engliſh reſolve to draw to their Quarters at Muſcleborough, which while they were doing, the Scots fell upon their Reer, and put them into ſome diſorder, but ſome bodies of Engliſh Horſe coming up, charged and beat them to their very Trenches: Lambert in this encounter was run through the arm with a Lance, and had his Horſe killed under him, and was wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his body, and taken priſoner, and reſcued. The Scots had ſeveral kill'd, ſome of Note, and a Lieutenant Collonel, a Major, and ſome Captains taken priſoners. After which, the Engliſh marched quietly to Muſcleborough that Night, but ſo harraſſed with dirt, and watching that they expected the Scots would fall upon them, which accordingly they did, for about four next morning, fifteen ſelect Troops of Horſe, and others, to the number of fifteen hundred, armed with Backs, Breſts, Head-pieces, Piſtols, Swords and Lances, commanded by Major General Montgomery, and Collonel Stranghan, came on with ſuch reſolution, that they beat in the Guards, and diſordered a Regiment of Horſe, but the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh being alarm'd, inſtantly fell upon them with ſuch courage, that they routed, purſued, and did
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:57818:36"/>execution upon them, till within a quarter of a mile of Edenburgh, taking and killing about two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, with ſeveral Officers of Quality; Cromwel to diſcover his generoſity, releaſed the principal pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, and ſent them to Edenburgh in his own Coach, which did very much rectifie the opinions of many, who by reports were perſwaded he was very cruel.</p>
            <p>The Army having again ſpent their proviſions, marched for a ſupply to Dunbar, where the parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments Ships conſtantly attended them with all Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, and then returning toward Edenburgh, they underſtood the Scots were keeping a ſolemn Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving for their deliverance, ſuppoſing they were quite gone, and would have come no more, but found themſelves much diſappointed: Whereupon the General Aſſembly ſent Cromwel, by David Leſley their General, a Declaration of the ſtate of the Quarrel wherein they were to fight, which he deſired might be publiſhed, <q>That the General Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly conſidering their muſt be juſt grounds of ſtumbling from the Kings Majeſties refuſing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="68" facs="tcp:57818:37"/>themſelves to the honeſt people of Scotland, wiſhing to them as to their own Souls, it being no part of their buſineſs to hinder them in the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God according to their own Conſciences, as by his Word they ought: And that they ſhould be ready to perform what obligation lay upon them by the Covenant, but that under the pretence of the Covenant miſtaken, a King ſhould be taken in by them, and impoſed on the Engliſh, and thus called. The cauſe of God and of the Kingdom, and this done for the ſatisfaction of Gods people in both Nations, as alledged; Together with a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owning of Malignants, although the head of them be received, who at this very inſtant hath a party fighting in Ireland, and Prince Rupert at Sea upon a malignant account, the French and Iriſh Ships daily making Depredations upon the Engliſh Coaſts, and all by vertue of his Commiſſions, and therefore the Army cannot believe, that whilſt malignants were fighting and plotting againſt them on the one ſide, and the Scots declaring for him on the other, it ſhould not be the eſpouſing of a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant Intereſt or Quarrel, but a meer fighting on former grounds and principles. If the ſtate of the Quarrel be thus, and you reſolve to fight the Army, you will have opportunity to do that, elſe what means our abode here: And our hope is in the Lord.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Having thus ſtated the cauſe of the War in diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with the pen, they next reſolve to try the force of ſteel, and fight it out, for the month of Auguſt was near done, and little action performed, ſave the taking of Collington-houſe and Red-hall by ſtorm, and in it the Laird Hamilton, Major Hamilton, and ſixty Souldiers, ſixty Barrels of powder, one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Arms, great ſtore of Meal, Malt, Beer, Wine, and other rich plunder. The body of the Engliſh Army removed forthwith from Pencland-hills, till
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:57818:37"/>they came within a mile of the whole Army of the Scots, and both marched in ſight of each other, a great Bog between only hindring their Engagement, though the Cannon plaid on both ſides. Cromwel drew forth a forlorn to charge them, leading them on in perſon, and coming near their body, one that knew the General fired at him with a Carbine, but timerouſly, which Cromwel obſerving, called out and told him, <q>That if he had been one of his Souldiers, he would have caſhiered him for firing at ſuch a diſtance.</q> This action of his was thought to have more of courage in it than diſcretion; the Scots unwilling to ingage, returned back to their Quarters. Next day, Aug. 28. the great Guns from the Engliſh Camp plaid hard upon the Scots, and greatly annoyed them, all which could not provoke them to fight, but ſtill kept within the protection of their Bog; the Engliſh being in ſome want of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, marched to their old Quarters at Pencland<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hills, and from thence, with much difficulty, to Muſcleborough to recruit, and then drew off their Forces, quitted their Garriſons, and marched to Hadington. The Scots attending on their right wing, fell into their Quarters with a reſolute party, and were as valiantly repulſed by a Regiment of Foot, commanded by Collonel Fairfax.</p>
            <p>Sept. 1. The Scots being advantagiouſly drawn up at the Weſt-end of the Town, the Engliſh drew Eaſtward into a fair and Champion ground, fit for both Armies to ingage in, but after ſeveral hours expectation of the Scots approach, finding they would not follow them, but only watched their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, they marched towards Dunbar, the Scots moving apace after them, and at a paſs attempted <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:57818:38"/>effected, and then boaſted they had the Engliſh in Eſſex's pound, as King Charles the Firſt had that General at great diſadvantage in Cornwal, in 1644. this paſs being a place where ten ſtout men may obſtruct the paſſage of forty, thereby to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them from any relief from Berwick, or perhaps to keep the Engliſh from running away; ſo confident were they of victory, being lately reinforced with three Regiments, and from the Hills that incompaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed this ſickly remnant, look'd down on them as their ſure prey: And indeed, the Engliſh were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vironed with all manner of apparent dangers, their Forces were leſſened, their Bodies weakned with Fluxes, their ſtrength waſted with Watchings, in want of drink, always troubled with wet and cold weather, and much impaired in point of courage, two thouſand at leaſt, being diſabled for preſent ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, were ſent to Berwick. On the other ſide, the Scots were ſtout and hearty, in their own Country, and upon advantagious ground, and double the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh in number, they being ſix thouſand Horſe, and ſixteen thouſand Foot, whereas the other were but ſeven thouſand five hundred Foot, and three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand five hundred Horſe.</p>
            <p>General Cromwel, and his Council of Officers, finding the Army unfit for further delays, reſolved the next morning, Sept. 3. to force a paſſage through the Scots right wing, or periſh in the attempt, and being in Battalia by break of day, they fell unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly upon the enemy with Horſe and Foot, who to hinder the Engliſh at a paſs, drew up all the Horſe upon their right wing, and valiantly received the Onſet. The word of the Engliſh was, The Lord of Hoſts; that of the Scots, The Covenant. The Engliſh preſt forward vigorouſly, and reſolved to vanquiſh or dye. After one hours diſpute, the Scots were wholly routed, the Horſe fled and left the Foot expoſed to all dangers, who were moſt of them
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:57818:38"/>ſlain or taken priſoners, the purſuit continuing eight miles from the Field of Battel. Of the Scots were ſlain about three thouſand, and ten thouſand taken priſoners, (many deſperately wounded) among whom were ten Collonels, twelve Lieutenant-Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels, nine Majors, forty ſeven Captains, ſeventy two Lieutenants, eighty Enſigns, beſides Cornets and Quarter maſters, with two hundred Colours, twenty two Cannon, ſeveral Field-pieces, and fifteen thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Arms. Thoſe of Quality taken were the Lord Libberton and his Son, the Lord Cromſtown, Sir James Lanſdale Lieutenant-General of the Foot, and divers others; and the Purſe to the Great Seal of Scotland. The priſoners were ſo numerous, that it ſeemed troubleſome to keep as to take them, ſo the General diſcharged near five thouſand moſt ſick and wounded, the reſt being about the ſame num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, were conveyed to Berwick by four Troops of Collonel Hackers Horſe. General Leſley eſcaped by flight to Edenburgh, by Ten a Clock that morning the fight happened, and carried the news of his own defeat to his Maſters, which ſo daunted them, that Edenborough was preſently deſerted by its Garriſon, and Leith reſolved to receive the Conquerors, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they could not keep them out.</p>
            <p>Sept. 7. Four Regiments of Foot marched into Leith, where they found thirty ſeven Guns mounted on Platforms, ſome Shot and Ammunition, with ſtore of Wealth. The ſame day Cromwel drew the reſt of his Army, both Horſe and Foot, into Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh, without any loſs, ſave the Arm of a ſouldier taken off by a Cannon bullet from the Caſtle. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which, the Lord General ſent a Trumpeter into the Caſtle, to invite the Miniſters to come and preach in their Churches, which they refuſing, the Engliſh ſupplied their places. He then cauſed a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection for Markets, and liberty of Trade in Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh and Leith, to be proclaimed by Drum and
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:57818:39"/>Trumpet, and marehed thence with his Army to Linlithgow, leaving Collonel Overton with his Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gade behind, and came within a mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e of Sterling, from whence Cromwel ſent a Letter to that Garriſon, expreſſing the Armies conſtant affection and tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the people of Scotland, which though hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ineffectual, yet being ſo far advanced into their country, deſired them to conſider of it, and deliver up that place to the Common-wealth of England. The Trumpeter that carried the Letter, was met by a Gentleman on Foot, with a pike in his hand, who told him, They would not let him come into the ſtorm, nor receive his Letter. In the Afternoon came a Trumpeter from the Scots, deſiring releaſe of priſoners; to which Cromwel anſwered, <q>That they came not thither to make Merchandize of men, or to make gain to themſelves, but for the ſervice and ſecurity of the Common-wealth of England.</q> The ſame day a ſtorm was deſigned up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Sterling, but it not being thought practicable, the Army marched back to Linlithgow, which they fortified and made a Frontier Garriſon, being in the heart of the country, leaving there five Troops of Horſe, and ſix Companies of Foot, and Cromwel with the reſt returned to Edenburgh, where the General and Officers kept a Faſt. The Kirk party alſo about this time, appointed a ſolemn Faſt, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring the occaſion of it to be, <q>1. To humble themſelves for their too much confidence in the arm of fleſh. 2. For the malignity and prophaneſs of their Army. 3. For the plundrings and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their Army when they were in England. 4. For their not ſufficient purging their Army. 5. For their Commiſſioners unlawful and ſurrep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious manner of proſecuting the Treaty with the King, and their crooked ways in bringing him home. 6. For their not ſufficient purging the Kings Houſe. 7. For their juſt grounds they have that the Kings
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:57818:39"/>Repentance was not ſound, nor from the heart.</q>
            </p>
            <p>After this, Cromwel took order for the effectual reducing of the Caſtle of Edenburgh, which the Scots accounted Impregnable by ſcituation, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a Garriſon of four hundred ſouldiers, and all manner of Ammunition and Proviſions, Collonel William Dundaſs being Governour: But the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, notwithſtanding all ſeeming difficulties, imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed many Scotch and Engliſh Miners, who went ſo near the Works of the Caſtle, that they carried off one Scots Colours, three hundred Muskets, and other Arms, without any loſs, though the Scots ſent many great and ſmall ſhot among them, ſo that the fortifications of Leith, and the Mining at Edinburgh, went on proſperouſly. Octob. 2. The Engliſh ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the great Church at Edinburgh, where they found one great Iron Gun, two hundred new Muskets, ſixteen Barrels of powder, ſixty five bundles of Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dileers, and Swords, two hundred new Halberts, three hundred new Pikes, and two load of Match.</p>
            <p>And now let us conſider the calamitous condition of Scotland, that when an Enemy was in the very bowels of their country, there ſhould be ſo many diviſions among themſelves, even to the deſtroving of each other; for one party in the North was for the King without the Kirk; theſe with Middleton keep the Highlands. Another were for the Kirk againſt the King, whoſe chiefs were Collonel Ker. Stranghan, and their Adherents in the Weſt. At third party were for King and Kirk, as David Leſley, Holbourn, and thoſe of Fife; theſe were then at Sterling, and moſt conſiderable, having the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Committee of Eſtates, and General Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, to countenance them. All theſe had their Swords drawn againſt each other. Things being in this poſture, Cromwel ſends a Letter both to the Committee of Eſtates, and to Ker and Stranghan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>This Letter was ſent by Collonel Whaley, who ſoon after received an anſwer from Collonel Ker, wherein they inveigh ſeverely againſt the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Army, and <q>That no Ceſſation or Treaty was to be made till the Engliſh were gone out of the Kingdom,</q> which they had unjuſtly Invaded: So that there being no likelihood of an accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, Major Brown with a party of Horſe, took in a ſtrong place called Dalhouſe, and in it fifty Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets, fifty Pikes, four Barrels of Powder, with ſtore of proviſions, ſuppoſed to be the Magazine of the Moſs Troopers (who kill'd divers Engliſh ſtragling for proviſions) ſome of whom were taken at Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lington Caſtle, ſeven miles from Edenburgh. Soon after, Lambert with two thouſand Horſe, marched toward Damfreize, Collonel Ker being then about Pebles, and Whaley in his march toward the Enemy, took in Dalkeith Caſtle with a threatning ſummons, wherein were ſtore of Arms, Cannon, Powder, March and Ball, the Wall of it was thirteen foot broad at the top: Lambert having with difficulty paſſed Hambleton River, the next morning Ker re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to ſurprize him, and attempted it with much courage, but the Engliſh being timely alarm'd, ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:57818:40"/>ſurrounded moſt of the Scots Horſe, of whom they killed one hundred, and took one hundred, beſides four hundred Horſe and Furniture deſerted by their Riders, purſuing the reſt to Ayre, Ker him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf being taken priſoner in the flight, with ſeveral other Officers. Collonel Stranghan, and Captain Griffen, with ſome others of the Weſtern party, came in to Lambert, who brought them to the Head Quarters at Edenburgh.</p>
            <p>Cromwel obſerving that the Mining of the Caſtle would be very tedious, he raiſes a Mount upon a riſing ground, whereon to plant a Battery, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the utmoſt endeavours of the beſieged, and having mounted four Mortar-pieces, and ſix Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering Cannon upon it, he ſent one ſummons more to the Governour, That for preventing further miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs, he would ſurrender the place to him upon proper conditions. The Governour anſwered, That he was intruſted by the Committee of Eſtates of Scotland to keep the Caſtle, and deſired two days time to acquaint them with his condition; but this was denied. Whereupon the Cannon and Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars began to play, and the Scots hung out a Flag of defiance in contempt of them, but they had not plaid long e're they took it in, ſo that it was judged ſome great damage was done by four or five ſhells that fell among them, and preſently put out a white Flag on the top of the Caſtle, ſending forth a Drum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, the Governour deſiring once again That he might have leave to ſend to the Committee of Eſtates, which being again refuſed, two Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of each ſide concluded a Treaty, whereby it was agreed, <q>That the Caſtle of Edinburgh ſhould be ſurrendred to his Excellency the Lord Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Cromwel, on December 24. 1650. with all the Cannon, Arms, Magazine and Furniture of War thereto belonging: That the Governor, with all the Officers and Souldiers, ſhould then march
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:57818:41"/>forth with their Arms, Colours flying, Drums beating, Matches lighted, and Bullet in mouth, to ſuch place as they ſhall chooſe; that ſuch Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants as have any Goods in the Caſtle, ſhall have them reſtored.</q>
            </p>
            <p>There were taken in this ſtrong Caſtle five French Cannon, five Dutch half Cannon, two Culverings, two Demi-culverings, two Minions, two Falcons, twenty eight braſs Drakes, two Petards, ſeven thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Arms, eighty Barrels of Powder, ſtore of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t, and other proviſions proportionable. It was much admired that this ſtrong Hold, the moſt Impregnable in all Scotland, ſhould be ſo ſoon ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred, conſidering its ſcituation and advantages being built upon a very high Rock or Precipice, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving only one entrance, and that very ſteep and nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, ſo that not above three can go abreſt, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looking and commanding all places about it, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that by the Cannon the Engliſh were often galled in their Quarters, though at a conſiderable diſtance. It was the common diſcourſe at that time, that it was aſſaulted with ſilver Engines, but whether Coverouſneſs, Cowardice or Treachery, were the cauſe, it was of very great conſequence and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to Cromwel, and the further proceedings to his Army.</p>
            <p>The ſharpneſs of the Winter, in that Northern Climate, was ſo extream about this time, that the War ſeemed almoſt at a ſtand, and the Scots were imployed in Crowning the King, who had been ſome time before at St. Johnſtons, where he received the news of the loſs of the Scots at Dunbar, and of the death of his Siſter the Princeſs Elizabeth, who died about the ſame time at Carisbrook Caſtle in the Iſſe of Wight. The Town of Scoon was appointed for his Coronation, where one hundred and fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ty Kings of that Nation had been Crowned before; thither therefore, Jan. 1. 1651. the King with the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:57818:41"/>Barons and Burgeſſes, in their Robes remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, the whole Scotch Army ſtanding all the way as a Guard from St. Johnſtons thither, having heard the Sermon preached by Mr. Robert Dowglas, fitting upon a Scaffold erected in the Church, he took the ordinary Coronation Oath, and ſubſcribed the Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Covenant, and likewiſe the ſolemn League and Covenant: After which he aſcended upon a Stage a little higher, and ſate down on the Throne, when the people being demanded four times, by the King at Arms, <q>Whether they were willing to accept of King Charles for their King,</q> and become ſubject to his Commandments: They expreſs'd their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with loud acclamations, God five King Charles the ſecond. Then the Crown was ſet upon his head by the Marqueſs of Argyle, and the Nobility touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it with their right hands, ſwore Allegiance to him in theſe words, <q>By the eternal and almighty God, who liveth and reigneth for ever, I ſhall ſupport thee to the uttermoſt.</q> The people alſo holding up their hands, ſwore obedience according to the uſual Oath. Then the King and Nobility departed in the ſame pomp as they entred, and after a ſtately Dinner return'd to St. Johnſtons.</p>
            <p>This being over, the Scots conſulted how to raiſe ſuch an Army as might drive the Engliſh out of Scotland; to which parpoſe, after they had Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated Collonel Stranghan, Smeton, and others, who came into the Engliſh, they gave out Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions for raiſing more Forces, and many new com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders were made, Midleton being Lieutenant Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of the Horſe. Soon after which, David Leſtey their Lieutenant General, with a party of eight hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Horſe, made an attempt upon Lithgow, where was Collonel Sanderſon with a Regiment of Horſe, who received them ſo warmly, that the Scors re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated without entring the Town. Cromwel about this time being willing to gain all thoſe Garriſons on
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:57818:42"/>the South ſide of the Frith, he ordered Collonel Fenwick, with two Regiments of Horſe and Foot, to endeavour to reduce Hume Caſtle, who coming before it, ſent in this ſummons to Cockburne the Governor:</p>

After which, collonel Monk with three Regiments of Horſe and Foot, laid Siege to Timptallon caſtle, which had much moleſted the country with their excurſions, againſt which they plaid their Mortar-pieces forty eight hours together without ſucceſs: They then batter'd the caſtle with ſix large cannon, which did ſuch notable execution, that the Scors deſired a Truce, and terms to march away, but none would be granted, ſave to have their lives ſaved, which was at laſt accepted; and the caſtle yielded, with all the Guns, Arms, Ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Proviſion therein; the taking this caſtle was of great concern to the Engliſh, the paſſage from Edenburgh to Berwick being now almoſt clear.

                     <q>My Lord, my ſickneſs was indeed ſo violent, that my Nature was not able to bear the weight thereof, but the Lord was pleaſed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver me beyond expectations, and to give me cauſe to ſay once more, He hath plucked me out of the Grave. So that now, by the goodneſs of God, I find my ſelf growing to ſuch a ſtare of health and ſtrength, as may yet, if it be his good will, render me uſeful, according to my poor ability, in the ſtation wherein he hath ſet me. I wiſh more ſteadineſs in your affairs here, than to depend, in the leaſt, upon ſo frail a thing as I am; indeed they do not, nor do they own any Inſtrument; this Cauſe is of God, and it muſt proſper.

               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:57818:44"/>At this time Ambaſſadors came to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of England, from Spain, Portugal, and Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; the firſt was reminded of delaying execution on the Aſſaſſinates of the Engliſh Reſident at Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid: The ſecond, not having full power to give ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction for the expences of the ſtate and loſs of the Merchants Goods, by means of that King, was quickly diſmiſs'd. The Hollander kept at a diſtance, rather wiſhing proſperity to the Royal party, than heartily deſiring peace with the Common-wealth of England: Soon after, Oliver St. John, and Walter Strickland, were ſent Ambaſſadors Extraordinary to the States, and were received with great ſplendor, and having audience of the States-General at the Hague, the Lord Ambaſſador St. John made a learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and elegant ſpeech, declaring, <q>That they were ſent over to the High and Mighty States of the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands, from the Parliament of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of England, to make a firm League and Confederacy between the two Republicks, if they think fit, notwithſtanding the many injuries the Engliſh have received from the Dutch Nation, Likewiſe to renew and confirm the former Treaties and Agreements of Trade and Commerce, made between the two Nations, wherein he ſhewed them the notable advantages of England, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of its commodious ſcituation for advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Trade, and all other benefits. Laſtly, That he was commanded to let them know how highly the Parliament reſented the murder of Dr. Doriſlaus their Agent, not doubting but they would do their utmoſt to diſcover the Authors thereof.</q> After which, the Ambaſſadors Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men receiving ſeveral affronts from the Royal party there, the States publiſhed a Proclamation to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it; yet theſe abuſes continued, and no puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being inflicted on any, though the common people often ſwarm'd about the Ambaſſadors Gates,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:57818:44"/>and aſſaulted their Servants; and the States evading any Treaty till they ſaw how matters would ſucceed in Scotland, the Parliament highly reſenting theſe proceedings, ſuddenly recalled their Ambaſſadors, to the great ſurprize of the States: Who thereupon endeavoured; by frequent viſits to them, to inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate their amicable Intentions, but the Ambaſſadors returned to England. And that which gave ſome jealouſie to the Parliament of their deſigns, was, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Admiral Van Trump, with a Fleet of Ships, lay hovering upon the Coaſts of Scilly, as though he would attempt ſomething againſt it, and the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of it being demanded of the States, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, <q>They had no other intent but to demand the reſtitution of ſuch Ships and Goods as the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates thereof had taken from their people.</q> With which anſwer the Parliament were ſomewhat ſatisfied, yet to prevent the worſt, April 18. 1651. Sir George Ayſcough, with a Squadron of ſhips, deſigned for reducing the Caribbee-Iſlands, was ſent thither, and landed three hundred Seamen beſides ſouldiers, and ſoon became maſters of the Iſlands Treſco and Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, taking therein one hundred and fifty priſoners, and killing twenty. They took alſo two Frigates of thirty two and eighteen Guns, and ſecured the beſt Harbour belonging to thoſe Iſlands. Hence the Enemy fled to St. Maries, their chief ſtrength, which yet was ſoon ſurrendred. Cornet-caſtle, in the Iſle of Guernſey, was at this time attempted, but through miſ-information of the weakneſs of the place, the deſign miſcarried, with the loſs of many Officers and ſouldiers. About this time Brown Buſhel, a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry earneſt ſtickler for the Royal party, both by Sea and Land, and who when in the ſervice of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament had delivered up Scarborough to the King, was taken and beheaded at Tower-hill.</p>
            <p>The Parliament of Scotland having adjourned du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Coronation of the King, met again in March,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:57818:45"/>and ſome differences aroſe about reſtoring ſeveral Lords of the Royal party to their ſeats in the Houſe, which yet the Aſſembly would not admit of, till they had paſſed the ſtool of Repentance, which Duke Hamilton did with ſome kind of ſplendor, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a Table placed before him with a black Velvet cover, and a Cuſhion of the ſame, and making a great Feaſt that day. The King having now got ſome power, endeavoured to regain reputation among his ſubjects, by putting all the Garriſons of Fife into a poſture of defence, againſt the landing of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, drawing what Forces he could ſpare, both Horſe and Foot, from Sterling, and joining them with the new Leavies, which for better ſecurity he Quartered on the Water ſide, and then goes to the Highlands to compoſe all differences there, and to incite them to riſe and join with him; from whence Midleten ſoon after brought a conſiderable body of Horſe and Foot, and the Town of Dundee raiſed a Regiment of Horſe at their own charge, and ſent them with a ſtately Tent, and ſix fine braſs cannon, for a preſent to the King then at Sterling, whoſe Army now conſiſted in ſix thouſand Horſe, and fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen thouſand foot, but the Earl of Eglington being ſent to the Weſt, with ſome other commanders, to raiſe more forces, coming to Dunbarton, Collonel Lilburn, upon notice, ſent a party of Horſe, who ſuddenly ſeized the Earl, his Son Collonel James Montgomery, Lieutenant Collonel Colborn, and ſome others, whom they carried priſoners to Edinburgh.</p>
            <p>At the ſame time a deſign was diſcovered, the Engliſh Covenanters intending a general riſing in Lancaſhire to join with the Scots, the chief Agent herein being Thomas Cook of Grays-Inn, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> who was taken and committed. After this, a ſhip bound from the North of Scotland to the Iſle of Man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by Tempeſt driven into Ayre, was ſearcht, and
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:57818:45"/>many papers ſeized that gave light into the buſineſs. And a party of Horſe and Dragoons marching to Grenoch, ſeized Mr Birkenhead, another Agent for the Royal deſigns, about whom they found ſuch Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Commiſſions and Inſtructions, as the whole In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue was diſcovered; upon which Major General Harriſon was ſent with a Detachment of Horſe and Foot to Carliſle, to prevent Inſurrection, or oppoſe the Inroads of the Scots. At London ſeveral were taken up, viz. Mr. Chriſtopher Love, Major Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, Major Adams, Collonel Barron, Mr. Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, Mr. Caſe, Mr Cawton, Dr. Drake, Mr. Drake, Captain Farr, Mr. Giobons, Mr. Haviland, Major Huntington, Mr. Jenkyns, Mr. Jequel, Mr. Jackſon, Lieutenant Collonel Jackſon, Captain Muſſey, Mr. Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, Captain Potter, Mr. Robinſon, Mr. Sterks, Collonel Sowton, Collonel Vaughan, and others; of all whom, only Mr. Love and Mr. Gibbons ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, being both beheaded on Tower-hill, Aug. 22. 1651. The reſt (among whom were ſeven or eight Miniſters of London) upon their humble peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and acknowledgments, were releaſed and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned. There happened about this time an Inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of two or three hundred in Wales, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared for King Charles, upon a report that the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Army, under Cromwel, was defeated in Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, but they were ſoon ſuppreſſed.</p>
            <p>Collonel Monk was now ſent by Cromwel to ſet down before Blackneſs, which had ſheltred ſome that had much annoyed their Quarters: After the Batteries were made, and ſome ſhot ſpent, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired Quarter, which was given, and the place ſurrendred. Yet the Scots grew very formidable, and made many Infals upon the out Quarters and Garriſons of the Engliſh, with much ſucceſs, by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the advantage of knowing the country, ſo that ſeveral were ſlain; whereupon, Orders were given for contracting their Quarters, by ſlighting the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:57818:46"/>Garriſons, and the Army was put into a march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing poſture for Fife, Blackneſs being made their Magazine; Captain Butler at the ſame time arriving in the Succeſs Frigate at Leith, with eighty thouſand pounds for paying the ſouldiers, which being diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted among them, infuſed freſh courage into their hearts.</p>
            <p>June 24. The Army being ready for a Campaign, General Cromwel ordered them to march to Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall, and thence to Peneland-hills, where they In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp'd, and the General in his Tent treated the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Lambert, General Deans, and other Engliſh La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and Gentlewomen, who came from Leith to view the Camp, and then returned again. The Army hearing the Scots were at Falkirk, marched to Lithgow, from whence they might ſee the Tents of the Scotch Army at Torwood, four miles on this ſide Sterling, and hoped to come to a Battel; but the King having drawn his foot into Torwood, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified his camp, which with the River and Bogs, prevented any aſſault, though Cromwel marched in ſight of them, and ſtood from twelve to eight at Night, expecting the Scots approach; but they only plaid on the Engliſh with their cannon at a diſtance, ſo that the Army drew off to Glaſgow, and from thence to Hamilton, but not being able to ingage them, he attack'd Kalender-houſe, where part of their forces were, which denying to yield upon fummons, the ſouldiers with Faggors paſſed over the Mote, and in half an hour poſſeſs'd the houſe, putting the Governour and ſixty two ſouldiers to the ſword, and this in ſight of the whole Scotch Army, who did not once ſtir to relieve their friends.</p>
            <p>Cromwel finding the Scots would protract the War, reſolves once more to attempt the taking of Fife, whereby to prevent them from having any further ſupplies: Whereupon, there were drawn out ſixteen hundred foot, and four Troops of Horſe,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:57818:46"/>who under the command of Collonel Overton were deſigned for this ſervice, and being imbarked in the twenty ſeven flat bottom'd boats ſent from Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land for this purpoſe, early in the morning they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to land at Queens-ferry, which with the loſs of ſix men was effected, and preſently fell to intrench themſelves. While this was doing, Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel, with his Army, marched up cloſe to the Scots, that if they had gone toward Fife, he might have ingaged them before they could have reached Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. The Scots receiving the alarm the ſame day, ſent four thouſand horſe and foot under Sir John Brown, to force the Engliſh out of Fife; upon which, Cromwel ſent Lambert with two Regiments of Horſe, and two of Foot, to reinforce the other party, who in twenty four hours were ferried over and joined. Whereupon, collonel Okey with his Regiment fell in among the Scots, whereby they were forced to draw up in Battalia, and ſo did the Engliſh, who were ſuperiour in number, but had the diſadvantage of ground. In this poſture they continued, facing each other, about an hour and half, when the Engliſh reſolved to attack the Scots by aſcending an Hill, and thereupon Lamberts right wing falling furiouſly upon the Scots left, they endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the ſhock with much reſolution, after a while the whole body ingaging, in a very ſhort time the Scots were utterly routed, two thouſand being ſlain, and fourteen hundred taken priſoners, with their commander Sir John Brown, Collonel Buchan, and many others of Quality. Of the Engliſh, few were killed, but many wounded. After which, other Detachments were ſent over to Fife, ſo as to inable them upon occaſion, to ingage the whole Scots Army. Immediately after the ſtrong Caſtle of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſgarrey, ſcituate on a Rock, in the midſt of the Fryth, between Queens-ferry and North-ferry, was ſurrendred to the Engliſh, the Garriſon being ſo ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:57818:47"/>that they were content to march out only with their ſwords by their ſides, to ſhew what profeſſion they were of, leaving behind all their Ammunition and Proviſions, with ſixteen pieces of cannon.</p>
            <p>July 27. The whole Engliſh Army appeared be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Burnt-Iſland, and the General ſent a ſummons for the rendition thereof; to which the Governour returned a modeſt anſwer, and the next day deſired a parley: Commiſſions on both ſides were choſen, and after ſome debates it was agreed, That all the Proviſions, Guns, and Shipping of War, ſhould be delivered to the Engliſh, &amp;c. and all the Officers and Souldiers to march out with Drums beating, &amp;c. Thence they marched inſtantly to St. Johnſtons, a place of great ſtrength and importance, into which the King had lately put a Regiment of foot, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they made ſome difficulty at firſt to ſurrender, but finding that Cromwel had ordered the draining of the Moat round about the Town, the courage of the Scots failed them ſo, that they ſoon delivered it up.</p>
            <p>The King finding his affairs in Scotland grow very deſperate, he muſter'd his Forces, and finding them to be about ſixteen thouſand Horſe and Foot, with theſe, and hopes of further ſupplies from his friends, he reſolves to return for England it ſelf, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly the Scotch Army began their march from Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, July 31. 1651. and the ſixth day after entred England by the way of Carliſle; which news co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to London, very much ſtartled the Parliament, and Cromwel was a little ſurprized thereat, who by ſtaying to reduce St. Johnſtons, had ſuffered the Kings Arm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to get three days march before him, which he excuſes in a Letter to the Parliament, and ſhews, That the Army acted to the beſt of their Judgments. Cromwel preſently orders Lambert to march in the Reer of the Scots, with a party of three thouſand Horſe and Dragoans; Harriſon was likewiſe
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:57818:47"/>commanded to attack them, if poſſible, in the Van, and the General himſelf followed with about ſixteen Regiments of Horſe and Foot, leaving the proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the War in Scotland to Lieutenant General Monk, with ſeven thouſand Horſe and Foot, who preſently took in the Town and Caſtle of Sterling, with Aberdeen, Abernethy, Dundee, Dimotter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtle, Dunbarton-caſtle, and ſeveral others, ſo that all Scotland was ſubdued to the Republick of England.</p>
            <p>The King marched forward with his Army, being proclaimed in all Towns as he went along, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed a Declaration, with a promiſe of pardon to all perſons, for all crimes, except Cromwel, Bradſhaw, and Cook. A copy of the ſame Declaration was ſent by the King, in a Letter to the Lord Mayor and Aldermen of London, but was by Order of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament burnt by the Hangman at the Royal Exchange. And a day or two after, at a muſter of the City Trained Bands at Bunhil-fields, conſiſting of fourteen thouſand men, Lenthal, the Speaker of the Houſe, came thither, and cauſed a fellow, with a Link, to burn a copy of the Declaration at the head of every Regiment. On the other ſide, the Parliament paſs an Act to make it High-Treaſon to correſpond with, or aſſiſt Charles Stewart, with any relief whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. At length, after many halts and skirmiſhes, long and tedious marches, of three hundred miles in three Weeks, the Scots entred into Worceſter, Aug. 23. 1651. from whence the King ſent his Letters Mandatory to Sir Tho. Midleton, and Coll. Mackworth, Governours of Shrewsbury, to raiſe Forces for him, but without ſucceſs. In the mean time, the Parliament raiſed the Militia of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and Cromwel and the reſt of their Army co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming up together, they ſurrounded them on every ſide with their numerous Hoſt, it being never known before in England, that ſo great Forces ſhould be
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:57818:48"/>aſſembled in ſo ſhort a time, which in the whole were judged to be above fifty thouſand, and the Scots in Worceſter no more than thirteen thouſand. The Earl of Derby, about this time, being landed, as was expected, at Wyewater in Lancaſhire, with about three hundred Gentlemen and others, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to raiſe the Country, while the Engliſh were buſied at Worceſter, and in a little time they increaſed to fifteen hundred. Collonel Lilburn was ſent thither to obſerve his motions, and Cromwels Regiment of foot being at Mancheſter, was appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to join him at Preſton. To prevent which, the Earl marched toward Mancheſter, whereupon Lil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burn endeavoured to flank them in their march, ſo to join the foot; which the Earl perceiving, preſt to ingage, and Lilburn being over-match'd in foot, the diſpute proved tedious and difficult, yet in an hour the Earl was totally routed, and many perſons of Quality taken, and five hundred common ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, with all their baggage, arms and ammunition, the Earl of Derbys George, Garter, and other Robes with the badges of the Order, but he himſelf eſcaped, and recovered Worceſter. There were ſlain the Lord Widdrington, Sir Tho. Tildeſley, Collonel Matthew Boynton, and other inferior Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, with about ſixty private ſouldiers. Of the parliaments party, ten were ſlain, but many wounded.</p>
            <p>Cromwel having diſpoſed the whole Army round about Worceſter, in order to a Siege, the firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable attempt was poſſeſſing a paſs upon the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne, at a place called Upton, which was done by a party led by Lambert and Fleetwood, who march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed toward the River Teame, over which was made a bridge of boats, and another over Severn, on the Generals ſide, upon which the Kings party took the alarm, and drew our Horſe and Foot to oppoſe the Lieutenant Generals paſſage, to whoſe relief
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:57818:48"/>Collonel Ingolsbys, and Fairfaxes Regiment of foot, the Generals Life-Guard, and Hackers Regiment of Horſe, were all led on by Cromwel himſelf: Then Collonel Goffe and Deans Regiments fell to ſcowring the Hedges, which the Kings party had lined, and beat them from Hedge to Hedge, ſo that being ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded by a freſh ſupply, they were forced to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat to Powick-bridge, where three Regiments of Scots more maintained another hot diſpute, but at length all retired into Worceſter, except ſome that were taken. After which, the Royaliſts renewing their courage, drew out what Horſe and Foot they could on Cromwels ſide, the King leading them on, they imagining moſt of his Army had been on the other ſide, ſo that by this bold and reſolute ſalley, Cromwels men were forced a little to retire, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a fight of four hours, wherein the King had his Horſe twice ſhot under him, the Works and Fort-Royal were taken, and their cannon turned upon themſelves, and the Engliſh entred the Town; upon which, many of the foot threw down their arms, which the King perceiving, rode up and down among them, ſometimes with his Hat in his hand, intreating them to ſtand to their Arms, add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <q>I had rather you would ſhoot me than keep me alive, to ſee the ſad conſequences of this fatal day.</q> But all proving ineffectual, the Earl of Cleveland, and ſome others, rallying ſome Forces, put a ſmall check to the Victors, whereby the King had the opportunity to make his eſcape out of the Town, which he did about ſeven a clock at Night in the dark, with ſixty Horſe, out of St. Martins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate.</p>
            <p>The whole Army now entring the City, the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers furiouſly fly through all the ſtreets, doing ſuch execution, that nothing could be ſeen for ſome time but blood and ſlaughter, till at laſt the plunder of the Town, and the priſoners, having a little ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:57818:49"/>their appetites, they think of ſecuring the reſt. Moſt of the Scots Foot were ſlain or taken, but three thouſand Horſe made their eſcape. The number of the ſlain and priſoners was about ten thouſand. Thoſe of Quality taken were Duke Hamilton, the Earles of Lauderdale, Rothes, Carnworth, Shrews<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury, Cleveland, Derby and Kelby, and ſeveral other Lords and Gentlemen; ſix Collonels of Horſe, thirteen of Foot; nine Lieutenant Collonels of horſe, eight of foot; ſix Majors of horſe, thirteen of foot; thirty ſeven Captains of Horſe, ſeventy two of foot; fifty five Quarter-maſters of Horſe, eighty nine Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenants of foot; ſeventy ſix Cornets of horſe, ninety nine Enſigns of foot; thirty of the Kings ſervants, nine Miniſters, nine Surgeons; one hundred fifty eight Colours, the Kings Standard, Coach and Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, with other rich plunder, and his Collar of SS. Many parties were taken in Warwickſhire, Shrop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, &amp;c. ſo that few of that great body but were killed or taken. <hi>M.</hi> General Maſſey being wounded ſurrendred himſelf, and after made his eſcape. <hi>M.</hi> General Midleton, Lieutenant General Leſley, were taken in another place; and ſoon after moſt of the Nobility and Gentry of Scotland were taken at a place called Ellet in that Kingdom, where they were aſſembled to propagate the Royal cauſe, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Old General Leſley, Earl Marſhal, Earl of Craw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, the Lords Keith, Ogilby, Burgoiny, Huntley, Ley, with many Knights, Gentlemen and Miniſters, which ſoon after were ſhip'd and ſent for England.</p>
            <p>Such was the ſudden change of the condition of the Scots and the King, that he who a few days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was proclaimed King of Great Britain, had now neither Camp nor Garriſon to retire to, five hundred pounds ſterling being offered to diſcover him; ſo that after travelling in diſguiſe, and through many dangers about England, he at length found an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to imbark at Shoreham in Suſſex, for New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haven
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:57818:49"/>in France, where he arrived Octob. 2. follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Of the great number of priſoners taken, none of Quality ſuffered but the Earl of Derby, who was beheaded at Bolton in Lancaſhire, and Sir Tim. Fetherſtone: Others of leſs note ſuffered at Cheſter, Shrewsbury, and other places. Nor did many of the Royaliſts themſelves expect any better fortune in this expedition than what happened, as appears by Duke Hamiltons Letter to Sir William Crofts, taken among other papers a few days before the fight, to this purpoſe: <q>We are all laughing at the ridiculouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our condition, who having quit Scotland being ſcarce able to maintain it, yet we graſp at all, and nothing but all will ſatisfie us, or to loſe all. I confeſs I cannot tell, whether our hopes or fears are greateſt, but we have one ſtout argument, and that is deſpair, for we muſt now either ſhortly fight or dye. All the Rogues have left us, I will not ſay whether for fear or diſloyalty, but all now with His Majeſty, are ſuch as will not diſpute his commands.</q> So that we ſee this undertaking was not the product of deliberate counſel, but of neceſſity and deſperation.</p>
            <p>This battel put a period to the Kings hopes of get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Government by Arms, and on the other hand, ſecured to Cromwel all his former Conqueſts; the influence whereof, though acted in England, was great in Scotland, for their principal Nobility and ſouldiery being cut off, they were no longer able to bear up, but were ſoon reduced to the obedience of England. And Cromwel giving an account to the Parliament of this great ſucceſs, he concludes his Letter by telling them, That this was a crowning Victory, which was afterward thought to proceed from the foreſight of his future Greatneſs. This fight happened Sept. 3. 1651. that very day twelve-month wherein the Scots received that fatal blow at Dunbar afore-mentioned. After the battel, Cromwel

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d no longer than to ſee the Walls of Worceſter levelled to the ground, and the Ditches filled up with earth, to diſcover his averſion to the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants for receiving his Enemies into it, and Sept. 12. came to London, being met at Acton by the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and their Speaker, the Lord Mayor of London, Aldermen and Recorder, and hundreds of others; to whom Steel the City Recorder made a Congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulatory Oration, extolling all his Victories and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits with the higheſt flights of Rhetorick, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying to him the words of Pſalm 149, <q>Let the high praiſes of God be in their mouth, and a two-edged ſword in their hand, to execute vengeance upon the Heathen, and puniſhments upon the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to bind their Kings with chains, and their No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles with fetters of iron, to execute upon them the judgment written; this honour have all the Saints,</q> praiſe ye the Lord. After which, he was conducted in triumph to his Houſe near White-hall, great number of Scotch priſoners coming after him, through Tuthill-fields to Weſtminſter, as Trophies of his Victories, and the Colours taken there, with thoſe at Dunbar, Weſtminſter, Preſton, were hung up in Weſtminſter-Hall. After a ſhort repoſe, Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Cromwel, and Lieutenant General Lambert, went to take their places in Parliament, where they were entertained by the Speaker with a ſecond Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulatory Oration, magnifying their courage and gallantry, and acknowledging the great obligation which the people of England were under toward them. The ſame day the Lord Mayor feaſted the General and his Officers, where mutual returns of kindneſs paſſed between them, to the ſatisfaction of both parties.</p>
            <p>Oct. 14. 1651. Collonel Hayn with two Regiments of foot, and two Troops of Horſe, were ſhipp'd at Weymouth for reducing the Iſle of Jerſey, in eighty Veſſels, under the command of General Blake, who
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:57818:50"/>came to St. Owens Bay, where the ſhips running aground, the men leapt out, ſome to the middle, others up to the neck in water, and ran aſhoar, the enemy playing hard upon them with great and ſmall ſhot, and gave a hot charge with their Horſe; yet after half an hours diſpute they fled, and left behind them twelve cannon and ſome colours. After which, the Engliſh marched further into the Iſland, within ſight of Elizabeth Caſtle, under which was a Fort called St. Albans Tower, where were fourteen Guns, which upon ſummons was delivered, and ſo was Orgueil caſtle, and ſoon after Elizabeth caſtle, upon very good terms to the Garriſon, and Governour Sir George Cartaret, becauſe of its great ſtrength. The Iſle of Man was likewiſe reduced in a ſhort time, with the caſtles of Peele and Ruſhen, both ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtrong, and almoſt impregnable (as well as Cornet caſtle in the Iſle of Guernſey) if the beſieged had had reſolution to defend them. About this time di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Admiral Popham, and Henry Ireton, Son-in-law to Oliver Cromwel, at Lymerick, which Kingdom in a little while after was wholly ſubdued, and brought under the obedience of the Government of England.</p>
            <p>The Parliament now paſſed two or three conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Acts, one for Incorporating Scotland into one Common-wealth with England; another of Oblivion and free pardon; a third to determine the Seſſion of this Parliament on Nov. 3. 1654. a fourth for the increaſe of ſhipping, and incouragement of Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wherein was enacted, <q>That no Goods or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities of the growth or manufacture of any pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, in Aſia, Africa, America, or Europe, ſhould be imported into England, Ireland, or any of the Territories thereof, but only in Engliſh ſhips, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the penalty of forfeiting the Goods and Ships: And that no Goods whatſoever ſhall be brought in, unleſs they be ſhip'd from the places of their
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:57818:51"/>growth and manufacture only. Alſo that no Fiſh, or Oyl made of Fiſh or Whale-bone, ſhall be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, but only ſuch as ſhall be caught in Veſſels belonging to the Engliſh. Laſtly, that no kinds of ſalted fiſh, from Feb. 1. 1653. ſhall be exported in any other ſave Engliſh Veſſels, with ſeveral other exceptions and proviſoes, in reference to Eaſt-India Goods, and of commodities from Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ky, Spain and Portugal.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This laſt Act was very grateful to the Merchants and Seamen, but did extreamly ſurprize and diſturb the Holl inders, as judging it would cauſe a vaſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution in their Trade, which with ſo much advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage they had long driven, to the loſs and detriment of the Engliſh Nation; who thereupon ſent Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors to deſire it might be repealed, but not ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding herein, they began to diſpute our ancient right of the Flag in the Britiſh Seas, by refuſing to ſtrike ſail to our Men of War, which occaſioned a breach between the two Republicks, for in May 1652. Admiral Trump, with about forty two ſail of Dutch ſhips, was diſcovered on the back of the Goodwin Sands, bearing toward Dover Road: Major Brown being near with a ſquadron of Engliſh ſhips, ſent the Grey-hound frigate to ſpeak with them, to whom they ſtruck their Topſail, ſaying, They came with a meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage from Admiral Trump, to our commander in chief, and coming aboard, ſaid, That the great North winds had forced them farther South than they intended, being compelled to ride ſome days off Dunkirk, where they had loſt divers Anchors and Cables, profeſſing they intended no injury to the Engliſh Nation. General Blake, who was Weſtward with the reſt of the Engliſh Fleet, having ſpeedy ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of this paſſage, haſtened toward them, and next morning, May 19. ſaw them at Anchor in Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Road, and being within three Leagues of them, they ſtood Eaſtward, and received an Expreſs from
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:57818:51"/>the States, upon which they bore directly up to our Fleet, Van Trump being headmoſt; whereupon, Blake ſhot three Guns without Ball at his Flag, and Trump anſwered with a Gun on the averſe ſide of the ſhip, ſignifying a diſdain, and inſtead of ſtriking his Topſail, hung out a red flag, which was the ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal for his whole fleet, and gave General Blake a broadſide. The fight continued four hours, till Night parted them, in which one Dutch ſhip was funk, and another of thirty Guns taken, with the Captains of both, and about one hundred and fifty priſoners. Of the Engliſh about ten were ſlain, and forty wounded; the Engliſh Admiral was much da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maged in her Maſts, Sails, Rigging, and Hull, but the reſt of the Fleet had inconſiderable loſs.</p>
            <p>This attempt of the Hollanders, while we were upon Treaty, ſo incenſed the Parliament, that all the Addreſſes and Overtures of their Ambaſſadors, and the ſending hither two more, could not appeaſe them; yea, though they by ſeveral papers endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to excuſe it, alledging, <q>That the unhappy fight between the ſhips of both Common-wealths, happened without the knowledge, and againſt the wills of the States, taking God the ſearcher of mens hearts to witneſs the ſame, and that with grief and aſtoniſhment they received the fatal News of that unhappy raſh action, and thereupon conſulted about a remedy to this raw and bloody wound, by appointing a ſolemn meeting of all the Provinces, whereby they doubted not (by Gods favour) to remove not only the outward, but inward cauſe of all further differences, for the benefit of both Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and to avoid the deteſtable ſhedding of Chriſtian blood, ſo much deſired by their Enemies, and therefore beſeech the Council of State, by the pledges of common Religion and Liberty, to do nothing out of heat, which afterward with vain wiſhes can never be recalled; which they deſire
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:57818:52"/>the more becauſe their ſhips of War and Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize are detained in the Engliſh Ports.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To this the Parliament replied, <q>That calling to mind the demonſtrations of friendſhip and good correſpondence, which they have always diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed toward the States General, during all the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles in England, they are much ſurprized at ſuch unſuitable returns, eſpecially at the acts of Hoſtili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, lately committed in the very Roads of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, upon the ſhips of this Common-wealth; and though they would willingly believe that the late Enga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ements of the Fleets happened without their knowledge or conſent, yet when they conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how diſagreeable the actions of that State,</q> and their Officers at Sea have been, in the midſt of a <q>Treaty offered by themſelves, and managed here by their Ambaſſadors, and the extraordinary pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of one hundred and fifty ſhips, without any viſible occaſion, and the Inſtructions given by the States to their commanders at Sea, they have too much cauſe to believe that the Stares General deſign, by force, to Uſurp the known Right of England in the Seas, to deſtroy the Fleers that are (under God) their Walls and Bulwarks, and thereby expoſe the Nation to be Invaded at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, as by their late action they have attempted to do: Therefore the Parliament think themſelves obliged to indeavour (by Gods aſſiſtance) to ſeek reparations for the wrongs already ſuffered, and ſecurity againſt any ſuch attempts for the future, yet ſtill deſining that all differences, if poſſible, may be peaceably and amicably compoſed.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This anſwer quite broke off the Treat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, and the Ambaſſadors having had audience of the Parliament, took their leaves and departed.</p>
            <p>And now theſe mighty States prepare to ingage each other, and accordingly General Blake, with a gallant Fleet, advanced North towards the Iſles of
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:57818:52"/>Orkney, to ſeize all Veſſels that were fiſhing there, who took twelve Dutch Men of War that were guarding the Buſſes, but diſcharged moſt of the Buſſes; and Sir George Ayſcough with his ſquadron, being left to guard the narrow Seas, diſcovered about thirty Dutch ſhips between Dover and Calice, of which ten were taken and burnt, the reſt run aſhoar on the Coaſts of France. Many other Dutch and French Prizes were daily taken. Thence Sir George Ayſcough ſailed Weſt, to ſeek out the Dutch Fleer, and Convoy home ſome Merchaur-men from Plymouth; and being within ſeven or eight Leagues of Plymouth, he had advice of them, whereupon he reſolved to ſtand over to the Coaſt of France, and next day, Aug. 16. 1652. had ſight of them, being about ſixty ſail of Men of War, and thirty Merchant men; the Engliſh were but thirty eight fail, four Fireſhips, and four Advice-ſhips, yet they reſolved to ingage the Enemy: Sir George Ayſcough and ſix other Frigates, charged through the whole Dutch Fleet, receiving much damage in their Maſts, Hulls, Sails and Rigging, yet they tack'd about, and charged them all again till dark Night, and had not ſome Engliſh Captains been deficient in their duty, they had probably deſtroyed their whole Navy. In this Ingagement ſome few Engliſh were ſlain and wounded, and three Captains; a Fireſhip of theirs was ſunk, with two other ſhips, but the darkneſs of the Night concealed their other loſſes, who ſtood away for the Coaſts of France, and the Engliſh for Plymouth to repair.</p>
            <p>During this fight, Blake came from the North in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Downs, and took ſix rich Dutch Prizes, ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome Frigates to reinforce Ayſcough, and ſoon after Captain Pen, with his ſquadren, hovering on the Coaſts of France, ſurprized ſix ſtout Men of War more, now returned from the Venetian ſervice, and richly laden. Sept. 5. General Blake riding in
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:57818:53"/>the Downs, had notice of a French Fleet in Calice Road, to whom he made up and chaſed them as far as they durſt for the ſands of Dunkirk, taking moſt of them, being ten Men of War between thirty one and twenty eight Guns, and ſix Fireſhips: This Fleet was to take in proviſions at Calice, for the relief of. Dunkirk, then beſieged by the Spaniards, who being prevented of this ſuccour, ſoon after ſurrendred, as alſo Graveling. Sept. 27. General Blake diſcovered about ſixty ſail of Dutch Men of War on the back of Goodwinſands, commanded by Admiral de Wit; next day, Blake with his Fleet bore in among them, but being upon a ſand called the Kentiſh knock, under which the Dutch had pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely ſecured themſelves, four of our chief Ships were on ground, but ſoon got off, and reſolved to ingage them, but the wind prevented them from coming up, yet with much ado, got next day within ſhot, upon which the Dutch ſet up their main ſails and ran for it, whom ten Frigates chaſed till Night, and next day purſued them till they had fight of Weſt Gabel in Zealand, and ſaw them run into Goree; upon which, the Engliſh fearing to ſail further upon the Holland coaſt, returned back. In this skirmiſh, the Dutch Rere-Admiral was loſt, with a Fly-boat that towed her, and many men killed; about forty Engliſh were ſlain, and as many wounded.</p>
            <p>The War between theſe two States reached to the Mediterranean Sea, whither the Engliſh had ſent ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Frigates to ſecure the Merchants ſhips from the Privatcers of Toulon and Marſeilles, and a ſquadron of four ſail, with three Smyrna ſhips under their convoy, happened to meet with eleven Dutch men of War, who having ſuch great advantage, preſently fell upon them, but met with flout reſiſtance, two of their main-top maſts being ſhot down, and one of their ſhips fired but quench'd again. The Phoenix, a ſtout ſhip of forty five Guns, was taken by the Dutch,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:57818:53"/>the Paragon loſt twenty ſeven men, and had about ſixty wounded; the Elizabeth had only two Barrels of powder left, yet in deſpight of the enemy, they brought their Merchants ſafe into Porto Congone, near the Iſle of Corſica, where the fight was. The Dutch much gloried in this ſmall ſucceſs, though they obtained it dearly, and more by their number than valour, the Engliſh never giving over while they had men or ammunition.</p>
            <p>The Hollanders extreamly concerned at the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual loſs of their ſhips, uſed their utmoſt induſtry in fitting out a Fleet, though it were in December, and the twentieth of that month, appeared on the back of the Goodwin with Ninety men of War, and ten Fireſhips. The Engliſh under General Blake were but forty two, and not half Man'd, moſt of the great ſhips being laid up, yet they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to ingage them, and accordingly, December 30. both Fleets met, the Engliſh having the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-gage, and as few as they were, ſeveral of them never came up pretending want of men, ſo that the ſtreſs of the fight lay upon a few who were to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter the whole Dutch Fleet. The Van-guard and the Victory, ingaged twenty of the Hollanders, from firſt to laſt, and yet got clear of them all. The Garland and Bonadventure were taken, and Blake going to relieve the firſt, had his fore-maſt ſhot by the board, was twice boarded, and yet got off, as did all the reſt but thoſe two afore-mentioned; and ſoon after, two Merchant-ſhips fell into the enemies hands. Blake with his Fleet withdrew into Lee-Road to repair, and the Dutch boaſted of this Victory, by their Ambaſſadors, in all the Courts of Chriſtendom.</p>
            <p>But this ſmall loſs did only rouze and awaken the Engliſh courage, who thought on nothing but Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge; and to incourage them, the Parliament or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the Seamens wages to be raiſed, from eighteen
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:57818:54"/>to twenty three ſhillings a month, and that for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Prize taken, they ſhall have ten ſhillings for every Tun, and ſix pound ten ſhillings and four pence for every great Gun, whether Iron or Braſs, to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided among the Ships crew, according to their Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and all upon or above the Gun-deck to be prize. Likewiſe to have ten pound a Gun for every man of War they ſhall ſink or deſtroy, to be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as aforeſaid, with a months pay gratis to all Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntiers that ſhall liſt themſelves within forty days; and care taken for paying and curing the ſick and wounded, with ſeveral other advantages: Which being printed and publiſhed, the Seamen came in apace, ſo that in February following, the Engliſh had a ſtout Fleet at Sea, though the Dutch endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to hinder all Mations from ſupplying us with Pitch, Tar, or Maſts.</p>
            <p>Feb. 18. 1653. The Dutch Navy, of about eighty fail, with one hundred and fifty Merchant men from Roan, Nants and Burdeaux, were diſcovered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Iſle of Wight and Port and, and about eight in the morning, the headmoſt of the Engliſh Fleet came up and ingaged them, which was Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Blake in the Triumph, General Dean, and three or four more, the reſt being to the Leeward, and not able to come up; yet theſe few held thirty of the Dutch men of War in play, from eight till two in the afternoon, when about half the Engliſh Fleet came up and ingaged the enemy till Night parted them. In this fight the Engliſh loſt only the Sampſon, a Dutch prize, which being unſerviceable, themſelves funk, the men being all ſaved, which ſhip ſunk the adverſary that maimed her. Next day the Engliſh chaſed the Dutch a good while, whereby ſome of the Enemies ſhips were brought to the Lee and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed. The day after they ingaged again, and the diſpute grew ſo hot, that the Hollanders began to fire out of their ſtern-moſt ports, and make away;
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:57818:54"/>ſo that fifty Merchant ſhips fell into our hands, and nine men of War, ſeveral others being ſunk, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides what they themſelves ſunk as unſerviceable, and it was writ from France, that above two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand dead bodies of the Dutch were ſeen about their ſhoars; fifteen hundred were taken priſoners and brought to London; General Blake was wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſeveral Engliſh Captains ſlain.</p>
            <p>The Dutch deeply ſenſible of this loſs, ſent a Letter to the Parliament of England, ſigned only by the States of Holland: To which the parliament re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned anſwer, ſignifying their deſire of a friendly compliance to avoid further miſchiefs; but it had no effect. But the Engliſh, to aliay their joy for this Victory, mee with a great check in the Streights, for having by a ſtratagem regained the Phoenix frigate from the Dutch, as ſhe lay in Legorn-Haven, they prepared for another encounter with them: Captain Boddily, with nine men of War, ſailed from Porto Congone, to aſſiſt Captain Apleton at Legorn, where he had been kept in for ſeveral months by twenty two Holland frigates; upon his approach, Caprain Apleton weighed out of the Mole a little too ſoon with his ſhips, and was inſtantly ingaged by the whole Dutch Fleet, who having the wind, their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral and two others b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>arded the Leopard, a ſtout ſhip of above fifty Guns, who fought bravely five hours, but at length was over-powered. The Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure, by a ſhot in her powder-room, took fire and was blown up. The Peregrine was ingaged with four or five Dutch at a time, and having her main-maſt and mizen-maſt ſhot away, was alſo ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. The Levant-Merchant was firſt boarded by one of the Enemies ſhips of thirty ſix Guns, and after two hours fight, by another as big, the firſt of which ſhe ſunk preſently after, and yet was alſo poſſeſt by the Dutch. The Sampſon was boarded by young Rere Admiral Trump on one ſide, and a Fireſhip on
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:57818:55"/>the other, and ſo was ſoon burnt. The loſs of theſe five Ships, was the greateſt damage the Engliſh ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained ſince the War began, and was done in the ſight of Captain Boddily and nine Engliſh frigates, who did not in the leaſt aſſiſt them; for which they were branded with Cowardice and Treachery.</p>
            <p>At this time the King of Portugal, unable to reſiſt the power of the Engliſh at Sea, ſent over an Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Ambaſſador to conclude a peace, and to give ſatisfaction for the Merchants loſſes. An Agent was likewiſe ſent from the French King, deſiring the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe of his Ships taken going for the relief of Dunkirk, and to have a right underſtanding between the two Republicks. And on the other ſide, four Deputies were ſent from the Prince of Conde, to crave aid againſt Cardinal Mazarine and his party, who had ſtrictly beſieged the City of Bordeaux, but all me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation proved ineffectual, the breach being too great between the two States to be eaſily cemented. Other Nations likewiſe endeavoured to be Mediators between England and Holland, as the Queen of Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, the Cantons of Switzerland, the Imperial Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Lubeck and Hamburgh, but all was fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs.</p>
            <p>This was the poſture of the Civil and Military af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of this Nation, when General Cromwel, with Major General Lambert, Harriſon, and ſeven or eight Officers more, came to the Houſe of Commons, April 23. 1653. with about twelve fouldiers, whom he ordered to wait at the door, and being entred, ſpake to this purpoſe: <q>You have ſufficiently delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the people, and provided for your own and your Relations benefits, poſſeſſing theſe ſeats un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a pretence of forming a Common-wealth, of reforming the Laws, and prom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

General Cromwel alſo commanded that bauble, as he called the Mace, to be taken away. When the Members were all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, the doors were lock'd up, and Guards ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, and all the Avenues of the Houſe. And thus was this mighty parliament diſſolved or diſmiſſed (after near twelve years ſitting, and after having tranſacted ſo many great affairs) and this without op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition or diſturbance; their powers transferred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of the Souldiery, and their Names re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>progched and vilified by the common people: But to ſatisfie the Nation, General Cromwel, and his Officers, publiſhed a Declaration which they had prepared the day before, of the Reaſons of their proceedings, as followeth:</p>
            <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">
               <body>
                  <q>
                     <p>Our intention is not, at this time, to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the grounds which firſt moved us to take up Arms, and ingage our lives, and all that was dear unto us in this Cauſe, nor to mind in this Declaration the various diſpenſations through which Divine Providence hath led us, or the Witneſs the Lord hath born, and the many ſignal Teſtimonies he hath given to the ſincere endeavours of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy Servants, whilſt they were conteſting with many and great difficulties, as well in the Wars, as other Tranſactions in the three Nations, being neceſſitated in the defence of the ſame Cauſe, they
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:57818:56"/>firſt aſſerted, to have recourſe unto extraordinary actions, the ſame being evident by former Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions publiſhed on that behalf. And after God was pleaſed, not only to reduce Ireland, and give in Scotland, but ſo marvelouſly to appear for his people at Worceſter, that theſe Nations were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to a degree of peace, and England to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect quiet, whereby the parliament had opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to give the people the Harveſt of all their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, blood and treaſure, and to ſettle a due li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, in reference to Civil and Spiritual things, whereunto they were obliged by their duty and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements, and thoſe great and wonderful things God hath wrought for them, yet they made ſo little progreſs therein, that it was a matter of much grief to the good people of the Land; who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, applied themſelves to the Army, who (though unwilling to meddle with the Civil Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority) agreed that ſuch Officers as were Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Parliament, ſhould move them to proceed vigorouſly in reforming what was amiſs in the Common-wealth, and in ſettling it upon a founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Juſtice and Righteouſneſs: Which being done, it was hoped the Parliament would have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered their expectations,</p>
                     <p>But finding the contrary, they renewed their deſires in an humble Petition in Auguſt 1652. which produced no conſiderable effect, nor was any ſuch progreſs made therein, as might imply their real intentions to accompliſh what was Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned for, but rather an averſeneſs to the things themſelves, with much bitterneſs and oppoſition to the people of God, and his ſpirit acting in them, inſomuch that the Godly party in Parliament were rendred of no further uſe than to countenance the ends of a corrupt party, for effecting the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire they had of perpetuating themſelves in the Supream Government. For which purpoſe, the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:57818:56"/>ſaid party long oppoſed, and frequently declared themſelves againſt having a new Repreſentative, and when they ſaw themſelves neceſſitated to take this Bill into conſideration, they reſolved to make uſe of it to recruit the Houſe with perſons of the ſame ſpirit and temper, thereby to perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate their owe ſitting; which intention, divers of the activeſt among them did manifeſt, labouring to perſwade others to a conſent therein, and the better to effect this, divers petitions preparing from ſeveral Counties, for the continuance of this Parliament, were incouraged, if not ſet on foot by many of them.</p>
                     <p>For obviating theſe evils, the Officers of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my obtained ſeveral meetings with ſome of the Parliament, to conſider what remedy might be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to prevent the ſame, but ſuch endeavours proving ineffectual, it became evident that this Parliament, through the corruption of ſome, the jealouſie of others, and the non-attendance of many, would never anſwer thoſe ends, which God, his people, and the whole Nation expected from them, but that this Cauſe which God had ſo greatly bleſſed, muſt needs languiſh under their hands, and by degrees be loſt, and the lives, liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and comforts of his people, be delivered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their enemies hands.</p>
                     <p>All which being ſadly and ſeriouſly conſidered by the honeſt people of the Nation, as well as by the Army, it ſeemed a duty incumbent upon us, who had ſeen ſo much of the power and preſence of God, to conſider of ſome effectual means where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to eſtabliſh Righteouſneſs and Peace in theſe Nations.</p>
                     <p>And after much debate, it was judged neceſſary that the ſupream Government ſhould be by the Parliament devolved upon known perſons, fearing God, and of approved Integrity; and the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:57818:57"/>of the Common-wealth committed to them for a time, as the moſt hopeful way to incourage and countenance all Gods people, reform the Law, and adminiſter Juſtice impartially, hoping thereby the people may forget Monarchy, and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their true Election of ſucceſſive Parliaments, may have the Government ſettled upon a true Baſis, without hazard to this glorious Cauſe, or neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating to keep up Armies for the defence of the ſame.</p>
                     <p>And being ſtill reſolved to uſe all means poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to avoid extraordinary courſes, we prevailed with about twenty Members of Parliament to give us a conference, with whom we freely and calmly debated the Neceſſity and Juſtice of our propoſals in that behalf, and did evidence that thoſe, and not the Act under their conſideration, would moſt probably bring forth ſomething anſwerable to that work, the foundation whereof God hath laid, and is now carrying on in the World.</p>
                     <p>The which notwithſtanding, found no accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, but inſtead thereof it was offered, that the way was to continue ſtill this preſent Parliament, as being that from which we might reaſonably ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect all good things. And this being vehemently inſiſted upon, did much confirm us in our appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions, that not any love to a Repreſentative, but the making uſe thereof to recruit, and ſo to perpetuate themſelves, was their aim.</p>
                     <p>They being plainly dealt with about this, and told, That neither the Nation, the honeſt Intereſt, nor we our ſelves, would be deluded by ſuch deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, they did agree to meet again the next day in the Afternoon, for mutual ſatisfaction; it being conſented to by the Members preſent, that endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours ſhould be uſed, that nothing in the mean time ſhould be done in Parliament, that might exclude or fruſtrate the propoſals before-mentioned.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="109" facs="tcp:57818:57"/>Notwithſtanding this, the next morning the Parliament did make more haſte than uſual in car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on their ſaid Act, being helped on therein by ſome of the perſons ingaged to us the Night before, none of them which were then preſent endeavouring to oppoſe the ſame, and being rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to put the main Queſtion for conſumating the ſaid Act, whereby our foreſaid propoſals would have been rendred void, and the way of bringing them into a fair and full debate of Parliament obſtructed.</p>
                     <p>For preventing whereof, and all the ſad and evil conſequences which muſt upon the grounds aforeſaid have enſued, and whereby at one blow the Intereſt of all honeſt men, and of this glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Cauſe, had been indangered to be laid in the duſt, and theſe Nations imbroiled in new troubles, at a time when our Enemies abroad are watching all opportunities againſt us, and ſome of them actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally engaged in War with us, we have been ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated, though with much reluctancy, to put an end to this parliament, which yet we have done, we hope, out of an honeſt heart, preferring this Cauſe above our Names, Families, Lives or Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts, how dear ſoever, with clear intentions, and real purpoſes of heart, to call to the Government perſons of approved fidelity and honeſty, believing that as none wiſe will expect to gather Thiſtles of Thorns, ſo good men will hope, that if perſons ſo qualified be choſen, the fruits of a Juſt and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Reformation, ſo long prayed for, and wiſhed for, will, by the bleſſing of God, be in due time obtained, to the refreſhing of all thoſe good hearts who have been panting after theſe things.</p>
                     <p>Much more might have been ſaid, if it had been our deſire to juſtifie our ſelves by aſperſing others, and raking into the miſ-government of affairs, but we ſhall conclude with this, That as we have
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:57818:58"/>been led by Neceſſity and Providence to act as we have done, even above and beyond even our own thoughts and deſires, ſo we ſhall and do, in that of this great work which is behind, put our ſelves wholly upon the Lord for a bleſſing, profeſſing we look not to ſtand one day without his ſupport, much leſs to bring to paſs one of the things men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned and deſired without his aſſiſtance; and therefore do ſolemnly deſire and expect, That all men, as they would not provoke the Lord to their own deſtruction, would wait for ſuch an iſſue as he ſhould bring forth, and to follow their buſineſs with peaceable ſpirits, wherein we promiſe them protection by his aſſiſtance.</p>
                     <p>And for thoſe who profeſs their fear and love to the Name of God, that ſeeing in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure for their ſakes, and for righteouſneſs ſake, we have taken our lives in our hands to do theſe things, they would be inſtant with the Lord day and night on our behalfs, that we may obtain grace from him: And ſeeing we have made ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten mention of his Name, that we may not do the leaſt diſhonour thereto, which indeed would be our confuſion, and a ſtain to the whole profeſſion of godlineſs.</p>
                     <p>We beſeech them alſo to live in all humility, meekneſs, righteouſneſs, and love towards ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and towards all men, that ſo we may put to ſilence the Ignorance of the fooliſh that falſly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe them, and to know that the late great and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Diſpenſations, wherein the Lord hath ſo glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly appeared, in bringing forth theſe things by the travel and blood of his Children, ought ſo to oblige them, ſo to walk in the wiſdom and love of Chriſt, as may cauſe others to honour their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly profeſſion, becauſe they ſee Chriſt to be in them of a truth.</p>
                     <p>We do further propoſe before it be long, more
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:57818:58"/>particularly to ſhew the grounds of our proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and the reaſons of this late great action and change, which in this we have but hinted at.</p>

            <p>The Hollanders hoped to reap advantage from theſe Revolutions, but found themſelves miſtaken, the Naval affairs being ſtill managed with as much ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication as before, as they ſoon felt to their coſt; for the Dutch having a great Fleet of Merchants ſhips Outward bound, durſt not venture through the channel, but with a Fleet of about Ninety Men of War, convoyed them by the North of Scotland to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the ſound, and there met with another Fleet of Merchant men Homeward bound, from Ruſſia, Eaſt-India, and France, whom they brought home ſafe, and hearing the Engliſh Fleet was Northwards came into the Downs, taking two or three ſmall Veſſels, and made ſome ſhot into Dover Town, boaſting the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Fleet was loſt, and that they would ſend a Hue and Cry after them, when on a ſudden, the Engliſh Navy arrived from the North, and came into Yar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth-Road.</p>

Our Fleet being at Anchor off the Gober, diſcovered the Enemy about two Leagues to Leeward, being about 100 ſail, and weighed toward them; about Noon both Fleets were Ingaged, which for ſome hours were very ſharp, ſo that in the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Dutch bore right away before the wind. Next day at Noon they ingaged again, and after four hours diſpute, the Hollanders would have got away, but the wind freſhing Weſterly, the Engliſh bore in ſo hard among them, that they took eleven Men of War, two water Hoys, ſix Captains, fifteen hundred priſoners, and ſunk ſix men of War more; the reſt eſcaped by the darkneſs of the Night and the Flatts. The Engliſh loſt General Dean one of their Admirals, who was killed with a great ſhot the firſt day, with one Captain, and bout one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty men more, and two hundred and forty wounded, but not one ſhip was loſt. The Engliſh were much incouraged by General Blakes coming in, during the fight, with ſixteen ſail of ſtout men of War. The Dutch having in the Night got into the Wielings, the Flye and Texel, it was reſolved to ſail as near the Coaſt as was ſafe, where the Engliſh lay for ſome time, taking many prizes, to the great damage of the Hollanders, whoſe ſhips could neither go in or out, from any one Port, to join together to oppoſe them.</p>

            <p>July 4. The perſons ſummoned to the number of an hundred forty four, out of the three Kingdoms, met accordingly at the Council-Chamber at White-Hall, where was General Cromwel and ſeveral of his Officers, who made a Speech to them, recounting, <q>The many wonderful mercies of God to this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the continued ſeries of Providences by

Next day he delivered in his Bill of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions to the Indictment; after that he demanded a Copy of the Judgment given againſt him in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, together with the Act: Then he joined iſſue, and made his defence for ſeveral hours, and about twelve at Night, the Jury brought him in Not Guilty; but he was ſent back to Newgate, and thence to the Tower, where he continued ſome time, and then turned Quaker, and dying ſoon after, was buried from the Bull and Mouth Meeting place near Alderſgate, with a numerous company of that party attending him to his Grave.</p>

An high Court of Juſtice was erected there, of which Cook was Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, by whom many Iriſh, and ſome of their anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Nobility, were ſentenced and executed for the bloody Maſſacre committed upon the Proteſtants in 1641. and about 14000 ſold to the King of Spain, and many tranſported into other Countries, the reſt being driven into the Province of Connaught, out of which, upon pain of death, they were not to ſtir without leave. The other three Provinces, Ulſter, Munſter, and Lenſter, were allotted to the Engliſh, and all forfeited Lands divided among ſuch Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers as had advanced money toward the management of the Iriſh affairs, and for ſatisfaction of the ſouldiers arrears. General Fleetwood ſucceeded Ireton as Lord Governor of Ireland, by order of Gen. Cromwel who had married his eldeſt Daughter Bridget, the Widow of Ireton.</p>
            <p>The Hollanders finding little advantage by the war with the Engliſh, ſent four Commiſſioners hither to begin a Treaty; during which there was no ceſſation of arms, for at the ſame time a remarkable battel hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened between the two Navies, July 29. 1653. The Scouts diſcovered a Dutch Fleet from the Wielings of about 95 men of War, upon which the Engliſh made what ſail they could after them, which the enemy perceiving ſtood away, yet about five in the evening, near 30 of the Engliſh ingaged, the reſt of the Fleet being aſtern, ſo that they bore the whole brunt of that days fight till Night parted them; the Dutch were obſerved to ſend away their maimed Ships in
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:57818:62"/>the Night, and in the dark got by with their whole Fleet, in order to join 25 ſail of ſtout ſhips more from the Texel, which the Engliſh could not prevent becauſe of the foul weather. Next morning the Dutch, with theſe new recruits, fell upon the Engliſh Fleet in a gallant poſture, and fought couragiouſly from five in the morning till one after noon, both Fleets paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing through, and endeavouring to burn, ſink, and deſtroy each other. At length, the Dutch went off with the loſs of ſome ſhips, either ſunk or burnt; the Garland, a ſtout man of War, taken formerly by the Dutch from us, was burnt by the VVorceſter: The Triumph and the Andrew were boarded by three Dutch Fireſhips, and had ſome damage in their ſails, but were quickly cleared. The Dutch obſerving themſelves decline, made away directly for the Tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, and the Engliſh being ſomewhat diſabled, and not daring to venture too near the Holland Coaſts, it was reſolved that the whole Fleet ſhould ſail for Sole Bay: The Engliſh Admirals in this fight were Gen Blake and Gen. Monk; Pen was Vice Admiral, and Lawſon Rere-Admiral. VVhen Monk with the Engliſh Fleet ſet ſail, and ſtood out to Sea, the Dutch ſuppoſed they fled for fear, which made one of the Captains deſire Van Trump to purſue, <q>For, ſaith he, theſe Skellums dare not ſtand one broad-ſide from your Excellency, you may ſee them plainly running home, and therefore, my Lord, miſs not the opportunity.</q> But Trump, who underſtood better, gave this ſhort reply, <q>Sir, look to your charge, for were the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my but 20 ſail they would never refuſe to fight us.</q> The Engliſh had 300 ſlain in this battel, whereof ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven were Captains, and 700 wounded, five of them Captains. The Dutch had about 30 ſhips ſunk and burnt, and their renowned Lord Admiral Van Trump was ſlain in the midſt of the fight, and out of the Dutch maimed ſhips that lay floating on the Sea, the Engliſh took ſix Captains, and about 1000 other
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:57818:63"/>priſoners. This was the bloudieſt Ingagement that had yet happened between the two Nations, and for their valour and conduct, the Parliament ordered Gold chains to be given to Blake, Monk, Pen and Lawſon, as a mark of their favour, and other chains were beſtowed on the Flag Captains, and Medals of ſilver to the Officers of the Fleet. It was after known by Letters from Holland, that they loſt near ſix thouſand men in this battel.</p>
            <p>The Parliament having ſate about five months, in which they made ſeveral Acts, one for Marriages be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Juſtice of Peace, another for relief of Priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, another againſt the High Court of Chancerv, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for a Tax for ſix months, at 120000 <hi>l.</hi> per month, at length they were conſulting of an Act for taking away Tythes, a Committee was appointed to conſider of the matter, who brought in their report Dec. 10. 1653. <q>That they thought it convenient that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners be ſent into all the Counties, and inabled to eject ſcandalous and unable Miniſters, and alſo be impowered to ſettle able Miniſters in all void places: That ſuch as are, or ſhall be approved for publick preachers of the Goſpel, ſhall have and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy ſuch maintenance as is already ſettled by Law. That upon hearing and conſidering what hath been offered to the Committee touching propriety in Tythes, it is their opinion that they have a legal propriety in them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Parliament having ſpent ſeveral days in this report, put the Queſtion, Whether the Houſe doth agree with the Committee, which was carried in the Negative; whereupon, ſeveral heats and diviſions aroſe, inſomuch that Dec. 12. a Gentleman ſtood up and moved, <q>That the ſitting of the Parliament, as then conſtituted, would not be for the good of the Common-wealth, and that therefore it was requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to deliver up to the L. Gen. Cromwel the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers which they received from him.</q> This motion
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:57818:63"/>being ſeconded by ſeveral others, the Houſe riſe, and the Speaker Mr. Rouſe, with the Majority of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, did, by a writing under their hands, reſign their powers to Gen. Cromwel, at White-Hall, by their Speaker, who thanked them for the pains they had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for the ſervice of the Common-wealth, though by a ſtrange ſpirit and perverſe principle in ſome of the Members, they had miſſed of their good inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Some of the Members continued ſtill ſitting in the Houſe, to whom Coll. White was ſent with a Guard of ſouldiers, and required them in the Name of the General to depart, for the Parliament was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, who replying the contrary, and that they were upon buſineſs, and ought not to be interrupted, he at length compelled them, though unwillingly, to leave the Houſe.</p>
            <p>The Parliament having thus reſigned the power gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them, the whole Authority, both Civil and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary of the three Nations, was concluded to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved into the hands of O. Cromwel, who calling a Council of Officers, with ſome others, to conſult of the ſettlement of the Government, they at length reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to have a Common-wealth in a ſingle perſon: That the perſon ſhould be O. Cromwel, Captain Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of all the Forces in England, Scotland, and Ireland, alledging, That it was not Monarchy which was quarrell'd at, but the Male adminiſtration and abuſes therein, by its prerogative being unlimited and arbitrary; all which would be avoided by circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeribing it in a Protector and his Council; a new In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of Government, and the ſupream power of a Triennial Parliament, in whom, during their ſitting, the Soveraign Authority ſhould reſide. In purſuance whereof, a Council was appointed him to conſiſt of twenty, but fourteen only were named at preſent:

<q>That the Title of O.

            </p>
            <p>After this, Dec. 16. 1653. the protector came from White-Hall to the Chancery Court at Weſtminſter, attended by the Lords Commiſſioners of the Great Seal of England, the Barons of the Exchequer, and Judges in their Robes, the Council of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, the L. Mayor, Aldermen, and Recorder of London, in their ſcarlet Gowns, and many of the chief Officers of the Army. A Chair of State being ſet, the Protector ſtood on the left hand thereof uncovered, till the Inſtrument was read, which he ſubſcribed in the face of the Court, and then ſwore to perform as follows:
<q>I promiſe, in the preſence of God, not to violate or infringe the matters and things contained in the Inſtrument, but to obſerve, and cauſe the ſame to be obſerved, and in all things to the beſt of my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, will govern theſe Nations according to the Laws, Statutes, and Cuſtoms, and to ſeek their peace, and cauſe Juſtice and Law to be equally adminiſtred.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Hereupon he ſate down covered in the Chair, the Lords Commiſſioners then delivered him the Great Seal of England, and the Lord Mayor his Sword and Can of maintenance, which he inſtantly returned: Then the Court roſe, and the Protector was attended
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:57818:65"/>back as before, to the Banquetting Houſe at White-Hall, the Lord Mayor bare headed carrying the Sword before him, where an exhortation being made by Mr. Nicholas Lockier, one of his Chaplains, the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Judges departed. And thus was the Protector confirmed in this high Dignity, tho' many of his Officers, and former admirers, were much diſcontented thereat, but to command obedience, the Council emitted the following Proclamation, which was publiſhed in England, Scotland and Ireland.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Whereas the late Parliament diſſolved themſelves and reſigned their powers and Authorities, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment by a Lord Protector, and ſucceſſive ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive parliaments is now eſtabliſhed: And whereas Oliver Cromwel, Captain General of all the Forces of this Common-wealth, is declared Lord protector of the ſaid Nations, and hath accepted thereof, We have therefore thought it neceſſary, as we hereby do, to make publication of the premiſes, and ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to charge and command all and every perſon and perſons, of what quality and condition ſoever, in any of the ſaid three Nations, totake notice hereof, and to conform and ſubject themſelves to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment ſo eſtabliſhed: And all Sheriffs, Mayors, Bayliffs, &amp;c. are required to publiſh this proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to the end that none may have cauſe to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend Ignorance in this behalf.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Protector began his reign with ſeeming ſere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and when the different parties in Religion made their complaints to him againſt each other, he uſually told them, <q>That his power was no greater in the Nation than a Conſtables, which was to keep peace and quietneſs among all parties.</q> And perſuant to the power given him by the new Inſtrument, he ſupplies the ſeveral Courts at Weſtminſter with the ableſt Judges and Lawyers; and the City of London, to ſhew their concurrence to this great change, invite the Protector to Dinner at Grocers-Hall, Feb. 8. being
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:57818:66"/>Aſhwedneſday, the Streets were railed to Temple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar, the Livery men ſtanding in their Gowns; he was met at Temple-bar by Alderman Vyner Lord Mayor, who delivered him the Sword, and receiving it again, bore it on Horſeback bare-headed before him all the way. After a Noble enterrainment, he was ſerved with a Banquet; in the concluſion whereof, he Knighted Sir Tho. Vyner, and would have done the ſame to the Recorder Steel, but he declined it.</p>
            <p>The Hollanders being weary of the Wars which they had maintained with ſuch little ſucceſs, and ſo great coſt, ſend commiſſioners to treat with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector for a peace between both Nations, which at length was concluded both with the King of Denmark and the Dutch, who were to pay the charge of the War, money being very neceſſary in his new Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and in April following, it was proclaimed with great ſolemnity in London, the two Dutch Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors making magnificent Treatments and Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works to demonſtrate their ſatisfaction therein.</p>
            <p>The Protector now ſends his eldeſt Son Henry into Ireland, of which he was made Lord Deputy ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and General Monk was ſent into Scotland: Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Lord Whitlock, who was ſent Ambaſſador, by the laſt parliament, to the Q. of Sweden, had now a new commiſſion ſent him from the Lord protector, in whoſe Name he continued the Treaty with that Crown, and afterward finiſhed it. In March follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Monſieur Bordeux was ſent Ambaſſador to Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land from the French King, and Sir Anthony Aſhly Cooper, Coll. Sydenham, and Mr. Strickland, were appointed Commiſſioners by the protector to treat with him, ſo that he was owned abroad as well as at home, King Charles was then in the French Court, who finding, that notwithſtanding his own and his Mothers endeavours to the contrary, the Treaty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween France and England was vigorouſly proſecuted by Cardinal Mazarine, and foreſeeing that if the
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:57818:66"/>peace were concluded, he and his party muſt be obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to depart France, he thought it more Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble voluntarily to leave that Kingdom than to ſtay till he were forced out by a complement; ſo the King, with his Brother the Duke of York, and his Couſins Prince Rupert and Edward, retired to Chattillon, a Houſe of the Prince of Condes, from whence ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the King and Prince Rupert went into Germany, and indeed it happened as they ſuſpected, for one of the Articles of the French King with the protector was, That none of the Royal Family of England ſhould reſide in the Dominions of France.</p>
            <p>In Feb. 1654. ſeveral perſons were committed to the Tower, about a conſpiracy againſt the protector, the chief whereof Sir Gilbert Gerrard, Coll. John Gerrard his brother, the E. of Oxford, Mr. Philip Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Mr. Vowell a School-maſter at Iſlington, and in June following, an High Court of Juſtice being erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they were brought before them, and charged to deſign the Aſſaſſination of the Lord protector, and thereupon Coll. Gerrard, and Mr. Vowell, were ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced to be hanged, which was accordingly execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon Mr. Vowell at Charing-croſs, and Coll. Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rard was beheaded at Tower-Hill, who expreſsly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the intention of the fact. With him, upon the ſame Scaffold, but not upon the like account, ſuffered at that time Don Pantalion Sa, brother to the Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Ambaſſador then Reſident in England, who upon conceit that he had received ſome affront upon the New-Exchange in the Strand, came thither one even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with a crew of idle fellows, Lacquies and Servants to himſelf and his brother, armed with piſtols ſwords, and Hand-Granadoes, and firing a piſtol, killed one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>r. Greenway ſtanding quietly at a Stall, and had done further miſchief, if this Coll. Gerrard had not ſtop'd their fury, and with his ſword drawn driven them all down ſtairs; upon hearing the matter, the Protector reſolved the murderers ſhould ſuffer with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:57818:67"/>reſpect of perſons, and it appearing, that though the perſon who committed the murder was a Knight of Malta, and had made his eſcape, yet that this No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble-man and the reſt were acceſſaries, he and four more of the Ambaſſadors were tryed and found guilty, with an Iriſh youth: Don Pantalion was beheaded with Coll. Gerrard, the Iriſh boy was hanged at Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burn and the other four pardoned; and peace being ſoon after concluded with the K. of Portugal, the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador ſorrowfully departed.</p>
            <p>In the ſame month a ſhip fell accidentally on fire on Southwark ſide, as ſhe lay at Anchor, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cut away, the ſhip was driven by the flowing tyde upon a ſhelf near the bridge, where ſhe ſtuck, and blew up her powder; there were eight perſons kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, one a Draper upon his Leads by the plank of the Ship, and had the blow been any nigher, it might have indangered the bridge it ſelf.</p>
            <p>The Lord Protector, in purſuance of the late Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, reſolved now to call a parliament, and Writs were ſent out for their meeting, Sept. 3. 1654. at Weſtminſter: Being aſſembled accordingly, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector went by Water from White-Hall to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-Houſe, and ſending for the Members into the Painted-Chamber, he deſired their company to hear a Sermon at the Abby-Church the next day, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he would impart his mind to them. About Nine next morning, His Highneſs rode in his Coach to Church, with whom ſate his Son Henry, and the Lord Lambert: The Pages went before, and his Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen in rich Liveries marched bare-headed: On one ſide of the Coach walked Mr. Strickland, one of the Council, and Captain of the Guards, together with the maſter of the Ceremonies: On the other ſide was Capt. Howard Capt. of the Life-Guard: Theſe were followed by the Lords Commiſſioners of the Great Seal, the Commiſſioners of the Treaſury, and the Privy-Council, in their Coaches, and in the rere
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:57818:67"/>came the protectors Ordinary Guard. As he entred the Church, four maces, the purſe, and a ſword born by the Lord Lambert, were carried before him: Dr. Tho. Goodwin preached the Sermon, which being ended, the Protector and the Parliament went to the painted-chamber, where there was an appearance of a number of grave judicious perſons, to whom the Protector ſpake to this effect:</p>
            <p>
               <q>Gentlemen, The parliament that are here met this day, are ſuch a congregation of wiſe, prudent, and diſcreet perſons, that England hath never ſcarce ſeen the like, and few could have thought of ſuch a door of hope not many years ago, and therefore it would have been very neceſſary and worthy ſuch an Aſſembly to give a relation of the ſeries of Gods providences all along to theſe very times, but that being very well known to moſt of you, I ſhall at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent omit it, and proceed to declare to you in what condition theſe Nations were when the preſent Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment was erected: It was apparent that every mans heart was againſt another, and every mans in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt divided againſt each other, and we had then ſuch different humours, that every thing almoſt was grown arbitrary. There was alſo grown up a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral contempt of God and Chriſt, and the grace of God was turned into wantonneſs, and his ſpirit made a cloak for all manner of wickedneſs and profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: Nay, the Ax was laid to the root of the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, and the fifth monarchy was highly cry'd up by perſons who would aſſume the Government, but that deſired thing wants greater manifeſtation than has yet appeared, before men ought to change the Authority to make way for it. While theſe things were in the midſt of us, and nothing but confuſion in the hearts and minds of ſome men, ſwarms of popiſh Prieſts and Jeſuites daily arrived here, to raiſe and foment diviſions againſt the peace and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et of the Nation: And at the ſame time the Nation
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:57818:68"/>was likewiſe ingaged in a deep War with Portugal, Holland and France, ſo that we were in a heap of confuſion, and it was abſolutely neceſſary that a ſpeedy remedy ſhould be applied thereto, and this has been in a great meaſure done ſince the ſettling of this Government, which is clearly calculated for the peoples Intereſt, let malignant ſpirits ſay what they will, and therefore with humbleneſs toward God, and modeſty towards you, I will recount ſomething in the behalf of this Government. For, firſt, It hath endeavoured to reform the Law: It hath put into the ſeats of Juſtice men of known In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity and Juſtice: It hath ſettled a way for trial and probation of miniſters to preach the Goſpel: And beſides all this, It hath called a Free parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; bleſſed be God that this day you ſee a Free parliament. As for the Wars, a peace is made with Sweden, Denmark, the Datch and Portugal, and one likewiſe very near concluding with France; yet theſe things are only entrances, and open door of hope. But now, Gentlemen, I make no queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to inable you to lay the top ſtone of this work, and I ſhall recommend this maxim to your conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, That peace, though it be made, is not to be truſted farther than it conſiſts with Intereſt; and one great work that at preſent lies before this Honourable Aſſembly, is, That the Government of Ireland may be ſettled in terms of Honour, and that you would avoid confuſions, leſt Foreign States ſhould take advantage by them. And as for my ſelf, I aſſure you, I do not ſpeak as one that would Lord it over you, but as one that would be a fellow ſervant to you in this great affair; and ſo to conclude, I deſire you to repair to your Houſe, and uſe your liberty in chooſing a Speaker.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Protector having concluded his Speech, the members immediately repair to their Houſe, and there chooſe William Lenthal, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> maſter of the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:57818:68"/>holls to be their Speaker; after which, they begin upon the Inſtrument of Government, and the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is in the firſt place propoſed, Whether the Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlative power ſhould be in a ſingle perſon or a parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Thoſe of the protectors party endeavour by all means poſſible to perſwade them, That it ſhould be no Queſtion, but be abſolutely carried in the affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative. This was as rigorouſly oppoſed by the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority of the Houſe, and among the reſt, a Gentleman who had all along ſtron ly oppoſed Monarchy as diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable to his Intereſt, ſtood up and ſaid, <q>The parliament cannot but diſcern the ſnares that are laid to intrap the priviledges of the people, and for my own part, as God has ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e me Inſtrumental in cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting down Tyranny in one perſon, ſo now I cannot endure to ſee the Nations liberties ſhackled by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whoſe Right to the Government can be mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured out no otherwiſe than by the length of his Sword, which was the only thing that emboldened him to command his Commanders.</q> Many others ſeconded this motion, confirming what he had ſaid, and directly againſt a ſingle perſon.</p>
            <p>Theſe debates and diviſions upon the protectors Inſtrument, which continued eight days ſucceſſively, did much diſturb him, fearing they would produce irreconcileable differences, and therefore to remedy it in time, and put the parliament into a milder tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, he goes from White-Hall to Weſtminſter, and ſending for the members then ſitting into the painted chamber, he thus addreſſes them:</p>
            <p>
               <q>Gentlemen, The God of Heaven knows what grief and ſorrow of heart it is to me to find you fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into heats and diviſions, but I would have you take notice of this, That the ſame Government made me protector which made you a parliament, and that as you are intruſted with ſome things, ſo am I with others, and that in the Government there are certain Fundamentals which cannot be altered, As
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:57818:69"/>1. That the Government ſhould be in a ſingle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and a parliament: 2. That parliament ſhould not be perpetual: 3. That the militia ſhould not be truſted into one hand or power, but ſo that the parliament ſhould have a check upon the protector, and the protector on the parliament: 4. That in matters of Religion there ought to be Liberty of Conſcience, and that perſecution in the Church was not to be Tolerated. The reſt of the things in the Government are examinable and alterable as the ſtate of affairs do require, and for my own part, my heart is even over-whelmed with grief, to fee that any of you ſhould endeavour to overthrow what is ſettled, contrary to the Truſt received from the people, and which cannot but bring very great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniency upon your ſelves and the Nation.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This was the ſubſtance of his perſwaſions, but doubting that this would not ſufficiently bring them over to his Intereſts, he contrived a Recognition and acknowledgment, which was to be ſigned by every member before he ſhould be admitted to ſit in the Houſe, as followeth:</p>
            <p>
               <q>I do hereby promiſe and ingage to be true and faithful to the Lord Protector of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of England, Scotland and Ireland, and ſhall nor (according to the tenor of the Indenture where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by I am returned to ſerve in parliament) propoſe or give any conſent to alter the Government as it is ſettled in one perſon and a parliament.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This was ſubſcribed by ſeveral of the members, tho' the greater number at firſt refuſed, eſpecially thoſe of the late long parliament, ſo that of 400 there appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only 200, but afterward were made up 300, who fell afreſh upon the ſame diſputes, and run over all the Articles of the Inſtrument of Government, reſolving to have the Judgment of the whole Houſe upon them in one entire Bill, and ſo preſent it, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to waſte time, and hinder the Protector from ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:57818:69"/>money which he much wanted, ſo that after five months dilatory proceedings, and that they had not yet ſettled him in the Government, the time being expired wherein the Inſtrument gave him leave, without loſing one day, nay ſcarce an hour, he diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the parliament.</p>
            <p>This diſſolution incouraged the moſt oppoſite par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to conſpire againſt the Protector, that is, the fifth Monarchy men and Royaliſts, the firſt expected King Jeſus, or the erecting of a fifth Kingdom, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond longed for the Reſtoration of King Charles, and the Protectors Favourites deſired King Oliver, and every party manifeſted their impatience, but none of them could attain their wiſhes, and when Oliver might afterwards, yet he thought it not ſafe. The protector was not ignorant of their deſigns, and reſolved firſt to deal with the weakeſt, for find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Millionary principle ſpread in the Army, he diſcarded Major General Harriſon and coll. Rich, and after ſent them, with coll Carew, and Courtney, priſoners to remote Caſtles, and General Monk had order to ſeize Major General Overton, and Major Bramſton, Holmes, and other Officers, and caſhier them. Overton was ſent up priſoner to the Tower, and his Regiment given to coll. Morgan. coll. Okeys Regiment was given to the Lord How<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>But the deſign of the Royaliſts, or Cavaliers, would have been more formidable, had not the whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance thereof been diſcovered to the Protector by one Manning, who was with King Charles in Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, and a Spy upon all his actions; ſo that Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel knew the riſe and progreſs, and firſt appearance of thoſe Arms againſt him, without being ſurprized,

Charles, who was come from Colen to the Sea coaſts, in order to have paſſed over to his friends with the firſt opportunity; according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, March 11. 1654. a party of 200 under Sir Joſeph Wagſtaff, coll. Penruddock and Grove, march'd into Salisbury, where the Judges, Rolls and Nichols, were ſitting at the Aſſize, and ſeized all their Horſes, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring the cauſe of their appearance without further injury, or taking any money, which lay in Serjeant Maynard and other Lawyers chambers, promiſing to return and break their faſts with the Judges proviſions, which they did, and increaſed their number to four hundred, the whole City being well affected to them. Thence they marched to Blanford, where coll. Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruddock himſelf proclaimed the King in the Market<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place, and ſo marched Weſtward. Captain Butler, with two Troops of Cromwels Horſe, following at a diſtance in their Rere, to give them opportunity of increaſing; but by the Protectors taking up ſo many before, very few came in, and many deſerted when they ſaw no hopes of the number of four thouſand which was promiſed and expected.</p>
            <p>Coll. Penruddock finding his affairs deſperate, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:57818:70"/>to try Devonſhire and Cornwall, and in this condition about 100 of the moſt reſolute, without ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any where, came hungry, ſleepy and weary, to Southmolton in Devonſhire, hoping at worſt to get a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by Sea, but that Night their Quarters were beaten up by Capt. Crook about ten a clock, and ſome Houſes forced, but coll. Penruddock maintained his Quarters till he had Articled with the Captain, and then ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred himſelf; with him were taken coll. Jones a Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of Cromwels, coll. Grove, and ſixty other pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, with 120 Horſe, but Sir Joſeph Wagſtaff, Mr Robert Maſon, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Clark, and Mr. Tho. Mom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſſon, eſcaped beyond Sea, and ſo this riſing was quickly ſuppreſt. There were ſome appearances of the like at Ruſtord-Abby in Nottingham-ſhire, at Heſſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moor in Yorkſhire, and in the Counties of Montgome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Cumberland, for which ſome few were exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted; but thoſe weak efforts, with ſome others, came to nothing, and the Kings Reſtoration which was migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily expected at this time, proved unſuccesful. After which, the King diſcovered the Treachery of Manning to him upon this occaſion; Some Gentlemen going for England, came to take leave of the King at Colen, to whom the King wiſhed a good Journey, and proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to their Deſign; when they arrived in England, they were ſeized, and examined before the Protectors Council whether they did not ſpeak with the King ſuch a day, repeating what paſt between them. Advice hereof being ſent the King, he recollected that none but coll. Tuke and this Manning, who held the candle, were preſent at this paſſage: He declared the whole matter to the collonel, who much ſurprized proteſted his innocency, and by the Kings command went di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to Mannings chamber, and not ſtaying open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the door, forced it, and found him chewing of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and a packet by him newly come from Thurloe the Protectors Secretary: at which, Manning was ſo much aſtoniſh'd, he could not ſpeak a word. His Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:57818:71"/>was kill'd in the Kings ſervice, and himſelf had been Secretary to the E. of Pembroke, and upon that account was intruſted with the Kings ſecrets. At the inſtance of the whole Court, the King ordered him to be ſhot to death in one of the Caſtles of the Duke of Newburg. The Protector had drawn 4000 foot from Ireland, and 600 Horſe from Scotland, but upon quelling this Riſing, they were remanded. Coll. Penruddock, and coll. Grove, were beheaded, and ſeven others were hanged at Exeter.</p>
            <p>The Protector had a great while been preparing a mighty Fleet, with all neceſſary proviſions, for ſome notable Enterprize, and every one fearing their own States, could not gueſs whither this deſign tended: At length, thoſe vaſt preparations produced two migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Fleets, one under the command of General Blake, which was fitted only for the Sea, and ſent to the Streights; the other, about two months after, was committed to the charge of Gen. Pen, who was to take abroad him an Army under General Venables. Theſe Land Forces being about 3000, were divided into the ſeveral Ships, which were thirty ſail of men of War, but had not neceſſary proviſions for ſo great an Army, the Commanders not knowing whither, nor how far they were to go.</p>
            <p>Dec. 19. 1654. This Fleet ſet ſail from Portſmouth directly to the Barbadoes, where the Generals had order to break open their Commiſſions, this being the appointed place of Rendevouz, whither having a fair wind, they arrived Jan. 29. following, and land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all their men in Carliſle-Bay.</p>
            <p>The ſudden departure of theſe two great Fleets, cauſed the King of Spain, who doubted they were deſigned againſt him, to ſend the Marqueſs de Leda, Governor of Dunkirk, into England as Extraordinary Ambaſſador, to penetrate into this grand Court ſecret, but having ſpent ſeveral days after his arrival, without receiving that ſatisfaction he deſired, he returned back again.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:57818:71"/>Whilſt the Fleet was at Barbadoes, the Officers were very diligent in their charges, and cauſed the Shallops which they had brought from England ready framed, to be ſet up, and the water Casks to be trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: Two Frigates are ſent to St. Chriſtophers and Nevis, to raiſe men to compleat their Regiments, and form Regiments out of the Seamen to ſerve upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion. At length, they ſhip'd 6000 men, and a Troop of Horſe raiſed by the Barbadians at their own charge, and ſailing thence, March 31. 1655. in ſix days arrived at St. Chriſtophers, where they had a Recruit of 1300 Voluntiers, moſt ſervants to the plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, who willingly ingaged, becauſe during the time their ſervice went on, and they might afterward be as free as their maſters, ſo that though the Fleet was ſtrengthned by ſeizing twenty Dutch ſhips, trading there contrary to Articles, yet they were all full, tho' there were ſcarce proviſions for half the number, if any accident ſhould happen. From hence they ſteer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed directly for Hiſpaniola, and April 13. 1655. came in ſight of St. Domingo, the principal Town, and againſt which they chiefly deſigned. A Council of War being called, it was unanimouſly concluded, That General Venables ſhould land with his Forces; and accordingly, next day he ſent aſhoar ſeven thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Foot, a Troop of Horſe, and three days pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, about ten or twelve Leagues Weſtward of the Town; the Souldiers were even raviſhed with the hopes of the mountains of Gold they ſhould obtain, which ſeemed to put univerſal courage through the whole Army, ſo that there appeared a certainty of Victory. But the General, whether by order, or to engroſs all to himſelf, ſoon quelled their expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by making proclamation, That upon the taking St. Domingo, no man ſhould preſume to plunder either money, plate, or Jewels, or to take or kill any tame Cattel whatſoever, upon pain of death.
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:57818:72"/>This it was judged defeated the whole deſign, the Souldiers being unwilling to endanger themſelves when there was no proſpect of advantage; howſoever they were obliged to march forward, tho' with much difficulty, paſſing through ſuch thick Woods that they were forced to cut their way, and could not find a drop of freſh water, ſo that with the drought cauſed by the exceſſive heat of the Sun, which even pierced their Brains, and their diſcontent of mind, (for ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row is dry) moſt of them were faint and diſabled.</p>
            <p>Having in two days got through the Woods, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out oppoſition from the Spaniards, they at length join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed coll. Bullards Brigade, conſiſting of three Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of foot, whom Admiral Pen had landed on the ſide of the Bay, about two Leagues from the Town, near a River of freſh water, being the appointed ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devouz of the whole body, which now conſiſted in nine or ten thouſand men, but moſt of them ſo weak as hardly able to go, much leſs to fight, yet being joined they marched on, not doubting but to take the Town quickly. A Forlorn Hope of 500 men, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Capt. Cox, the chief guide to this place, advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced firſt, after whom followed the whole Army; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing within four miles of the Town, a ſmall party of Horſe ſuddenly encounter the Forlorn Hope, and in an inſtant routed them, forcing them through the next Regiment, which they likewiſe put to flight, and had ſlain moſt of them, but that the whole Army came up to their relief. After which, the Spaniards marched back to their Fort in good order, and with little loſs, but near fifty Engliſh were ſlain, beſides Captain Cox their Guide.</p>
            <p>The General hereupon retreats to the River to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh his men with water, which cauſed their weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, reſolving once more to attempt carrying the Town, cauſing Scaling ladders to be made, and two ſmall Drakes, with a Mortar-piece, to be landed from the Fleet, and conveyed by water near the Town:
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:57818:72"/>All things prepared, they march forward, ſome guides undertaking to carry them a private way out of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the Fort, but miſſing it, they fell into the ſame path, and into worſe miſchief than before, for the Spaniards having notice of their march by the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes and Molattoes, reſolved to entertain them in their paſſage, and April 25. the whole Army ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching near a brick Fort built by the Spaniards, having nine good Cannon, and 300 men, they were ſuddenly charged by a party hid among the Trees, who though not above ſeventy, firſt fired a Volley of ſhot upon the Forlorn, and th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n flew in upon the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, already weary, and near choak'd with thirſt, and with their Steel Lances routed, in a moment, both them and the Generals Regiment, with near half the Army, who flying back into the Rear, poſſeſt them with ſuch a pannick fear, that every one ſhifted for himſelf, the Spaniards purſuing with great ſlaughter, finding no reſiſtance but from M. Gen. Haines, who ſold his life at a dear rate, fighting in the midſt of his Enemies; at length, the Spaniards weary of killing, retreated with ſeven Engliſh Colours. Of the Engliſh 600 were ſlain on the place, 300 wounded, and 200 fled into the Woods to ſave themſelves, and were there knock'd on the head by the Malatto's and Negro's.</p>
            <p>Upon this diſaſter, the Army that Night drew up to the Spaniſh Fort, and planted a Mortar convenient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt it, all things being in readineſs for a battery, when on a ſudden the Army was commanded to draw off, and without doing any damage, marched to their old watering place the Bay, where being arrived, and wanting Victuals, they were forced to go out in pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to fetch it, ſome never returning, being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> by the Negroes, till at laſt they were forced, by famine, to eat the Horſes of their own Troop. In this miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſtate they continued ſome days, at length it was reſolved, that May 3. they ſhould all go aboard, and in ten days they arrived in the chief Port of Jamaica,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:57818:73"/>called Oriſtano, where they had better ſucceſs, ſoon poſſeſſing the Town, and then the Army began to take up their Habitations, and to plant. This was the firſt planting of this gallant Iſland by the Engliſh, which has ſince grown ſo rich and populous, and of ſo great advantage to this Kingdom, and they gained it the more eaſily, becauſe at their landing it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved by a Council of War, that if any man turned his back to the enemy, his bringer up ſhould kill him: And the Spaniards having no Intelligence of their late overthrow at Hiſpaniola, nor indeed ſuſpecting any Hoſtility, fled away at the approach of this for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable Army, and withdrew their Goods into the Woods, by a pretended Treaty with the Engliſh, whither parties were ſent to follow them, and to kill Cattel for the Army, of which they found ſtore of very good, without fighting, to their great relief. Soon after, the Generals Pen and Venables arrived in England, and the protector in reward of their Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, committed them both priſoners to the Tower.</p>
            <p>A little to alleviate this misfortune, Gen. Blake, about this time, being ſent to the Streights with a gallant Fleet, to ſcour the Seas of Turkiſh pyrates, who had taken and deſtroyed many Engliſh Ships, and enſlaved their perſons; he firſt ſeeks them out at Sea, but not finding them, reſolves to go home to them, and March 10. 1655. arrives at Algiers, and Anchored without the mold, ſending a meſſenger to demand ſatisfaction of the Dey, for the depredations committed on the Engliſh, and required the delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Captives of our Nation immediately. The Dey having provided a large preſent of Beef and Mutton, and other freſh proviſions alive, returns the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eſſenger with them, and this anſwer to the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, <q>That the Ships and Captives already taken, belonged to particular men, and therefore it lay not in his power to reſtore them withou the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral diſcontent of all his ſubjects; yet as for the
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:57818:73"/>Engliſh Captives that were there, if he pleaſed to redeem them he ſhould, and he would ſet a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable and indifferent price upon their heads, and that if the General thought good, they would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude a peace with him, and for the future offer no Acts of Hoſtility on their part, to any of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Ships or Natives.</q> This anſwer ſeemed ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory to the General, and accordingly the captives were redeemed, and a peace concluded.</p>
            <p>Having thus diſpatch'd the affair of Algiers, Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Blake ſails next to Tunis, where ſending a ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons to the Dey, he received a very diſobliging anſwer; for having ſecured their ſhips, as they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, under their Caſtles, they in ſcorn and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt ſent him word, <q>Here are the Caſtles of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letta, and our Ships and Caſtles of Porto Ferino, do your worſt, but do not think that we are affrighted at the ſight of your Fleet.</q> This reſolute reply ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperated both the General and Seamen, who reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be revenged, and a Council of War being cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, it was reſolved to burn the nine ſhips that were in Porto Ferino, which they accordingly effected; for every ſhips Boat being manned with ſtout and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Mariners, were ſent into the Harbour to aſſault and fire the ſhips, whilſt the Admiral, Vice-Admiral, and Rere Admiral, play broad-ſides continually on the Caſtle, to prevent their ſinking the boats, who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a brave aſſault, burnt the ſhips, and return back again only with the loſs of 25 men, and 48 wounded. This daring action of General Blake, reſounded to the honour of the Engliſh Nation, as far as the Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niors Court at Conſtantinople.</p>
            <p>But to digreſs a little, about this time Chriſtians, Queen of Sweden, to the admiration of all Europe, reſigned up the Crown and Kingdom to her Kinſman Carolus Guſtavus, being contented, from a mighty Princeſs, to put her ſelf into the condition of a Lady Errant, deſiring only theſe conditions might be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:57818:74"/>her from her ſucceſſor: <q>1. That ſhe retain a good part of her Kingdom, and the cuſtoms, to her ſelf. 2. That ſhe will be no ſubject, but abſolutely free without controul. 3. That ſhe will Travel whether ſhe pleaſeth.</q> To theſe Prince Charles made this reply: 1. <q>That he would not be a King without a Kingdom. 2. That he will have no Rival nor Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior. 3. That he will not hazard himſelf about her deſigns abroad.</q> However, theſe differences were ſo accommodated, that ſoon after ſhe reſigned her Kingdom, leaving to her ſelf only the bear Title of Queen, but to him both the Title of King and poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Kingdom. With this new King, the Lord Whitlock, who had been ſome time Ambaſſador there, ſoon concluded a firm League Offenſive and Defenſive between theſe two Nations, the effects whereof had ſoon appeared in Chriſtendom, had Cromwel lived much longer than he did.</p>
            <p>The horrible maſſacre committed at this time upon the proteſtants in Piedmont and Savoy, by the Forces of that Duke, under the Marqueſs of Parella, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned the protector to appoint a publick Faſt, and great ſums of money were gathered in England, and remitted to Sir Samuel Morland for their relief.</p>
            <p>And now the Lord protector, to ſecure himſelf from Inſurrections, conſtitutes new kind of Officers, called Major Generals of Counties, dividing the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom into eleven parts; the Names of whom are theſe: For Kent and Surrey coll. Kelſey; for Suſſex, Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, and Berkſhire, coll. Goff; for Wilts, Gloceſter, Dorſet, Somerſet, Devon and Cornwall, coll. Desborow; for Oxford-ſhire, Bucks, Hartford, Cambridge, Iſle of Ely, Eſſex, Norfolk and Suffolk, Lt. Gen. Fleetwood; for the City of London M. Gen. Skippon; for Lincoln, Nottingham, Derby, Warwick and Leiceſter-ſhire, Commiſſary Gen. Whaley; for Northampton, Bedford, Rutland and Huntington, Maj.

The greateſt ſervice they did was to oblige Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents to pay in the Tenths of their Eſtates for old offences, and influence Elections of Parliament men, but in a ſhort time he diſmiſs'd them again.</p>
            <p>Another deſign of the protectors was the admiſſion of the Jews into England, for which it was ſaid they offered 200000 <hi>l.</hi> whereupon he propoſes it to ſeveral Judges and Miniſters for their approbation; many ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments were uſed for and againſt it, and ſeveral pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Scripture cited, and divers conferences held about it, with Dr. Manton, Mr. Jenkyns and others, who yet were not ſatisfied with the arguments of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſch Ben Iſrael the Jewiſh Agent, though the Iro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector alledged, <q>That ſince there was a promiſe for their converſion, means muſt be uſed to that end, which is the preaching of the Goſpel, and that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be had unleſs they be permitted to reſide where the Goſpel is preached;</q> but no concluſion, the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick re-admiſſion of them was laid aſide, as a thing decried both by the Clergy and Laity.</p>
            <p>The Spaniards having certain Intelligence of the attempt and repulſe of the Engliſh at Hiſpaniola, and their poſſeſſion of Jamaica, thought this a ſufficient breach of the peace, though there was never any peace made with that King beyond the Line, he always taking all Engliſh ſhips he could meet with and maſter that Traded there; and hereupon, he makes a ſeizure of all the Merchants perſons and Goods then in Spain, ſo that the War begins to grow hot both in the old and new World. The Protector thereupon, orders the Generals Blake and Montague, to block up Cadiz, the chief Port Town of that Kingdom, and whither the Plate Fleet uſed yearly to come. He likewiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes a peace with France (which was at Wars with
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:57818:75"/>Spain a long time) by the Intereſt of Cardinal Maza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, the French King (as you have heard) baniſhing all the Royal Family of England (except the Queen mother) out of his Dominions, at the deſire of Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel, and by the Inſtigation of that Cardinal.</p>
            <p>The Engliſh Fleet under Montague and Blake, had for ſome months, in a manner, beſieged Cadiz by Sea, but could by no provocation oblige the Spaniard to fight them, who hoping that the Engliſh having ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered the fatigues of the Sea, would be forced to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part for want of proviſions, thought it better policy to loſe a little honour, rather than to venture either men or ſhips, againſt thoſe who had maintained ſuch ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Sea fights againſt the Hollanders; but the Engliſh found in Wyers Bay in Portugal, a convenient ſupply of water and proviſions, which was much nearer than the Spaniards imagined. Hither were the Generals gone for freſh water and proviſions, having only left a ſquadron of 7 ſhips under Capt. Stainer, before the port of Cadiz, to obſerve all ſhips paſſing in or out; as they were thus plying for ſome days, it happened that a ſtiff gale of wind forced Capt. Stainer to ſtand out to Sea, where he eſpied part of the K. of Spains plate Fleet coming from the Weſt-Indies, and making directly for Cadiz, he was ſomewhat to the Leeward, but made up toward them with all the ſail they could poſſible, and after ſome hours with much labour, the Captain in the Speaker, with the Bridgwater and Ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth Frigates, got up to them, the other four ſhips not being able to come up, and preſently ingaged them; the Spaniſh Fleet conſiſted in 8 tall ſhips or Galleons, yet in a ſhort time they were wholly ſpoil'd, one was ſunk, three burnt, two ran aſhoar and were bulged, one eſcaped, and two fell into the hands of the Engliſh, one whereof had a great quantity of plate and Cockeweal in her, the other were chiefly laden with Hydes. In theſe ſhips, many perſons of Quality were taken, and among others the two Sons of the Marqueſs

            <p>
               <q>Mr. Speaker, I perceive that among theſe many Acts of parliament, there hath been very great care had by the parliament to provide for the juſt and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary ſupport of the Common-wealth, by theſe Bills for levying of money now brought to me, which I have given my conſent unto; and underſtanding it hath been the practice of thoſe who have bene chief Governors, to acknowledge with thanks to the Commons, their care and regard of the publick, I

At the North of the Haven is a caſtle well fortified with cannon, beſides ſeven Forts more, with three, four, and ſix Guns apiece, ſo that the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>erprize ſeemed dangerous, if not deſperate: And Don Diego D' aquies, had cauſed all the ſmaller ſhips to be moared along the ſhoar to ſecure them, and the ſix great Gallions lay further off at anchor, with their broad-ſides toward the Sea. Blake perceiving all this, calls a Council of VVar, where it was reſolved to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack them inſtantly, without any thought of danger; Capt. Stainer in the Speaker, preſently falls upon the ſhips, diſregarding the number of ſhot which came thundring from the Forts on every ſide as thick as hail, and maintains near an hours fight, till the Generals, blake and Montague, having ordered ſome Frigates to ply the Forts and Breaſt-words, with continual broad-ſiees, came up, and with all their force at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack'd the Spaniards, who after four hours gallant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, were driven out of their ſhips, which the Engliſh could not eaſily bring away, and were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore forced to burn to the number of ſixteen ſmall and great. This gallant attempt coſt the Engliſh but 48 men, and 120 wounded. The Spaniards, beſides the loſs of their whole Fleet, had ſeveral hundreds of men ſlain on the ſhoar, and in the Forts and VVorks, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides thoſe kill'd in the ſhips. For this notable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploit, the Protector, by order of parliament, ſent a

            <p>At this time one Miles Syndercomb, an Officer for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly in Scotland, under M. Gen.

Tho. VVid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drington, their ſpeaker, made a ſpeech, wherein he declared, <q>1. The danger and ruine of the Reformed Churches abroad, and three Nations at home, who were ſtruck at by this blow: 2. The cunning ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy of it, that no more than two ſhould be privy to this wicked deſign: 3. The extenſiveneſs of it, reſolving if they failed in one place to do it in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo that if Cicero were living, he would want expreſſion to ſet out the danger and the mercy, and it being ſo unparallell'd and unpreſedented a delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, the parliaments Hymn ought to be, O Cante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, Cantemus, Canticum Novum, Other us ſing a new ſong to the Lord, bleſs his Name, hew forth his ſalvation this day, for he hath done marvelous things, his right hand, and his holy arm, hath gotten him the Victory.</q> As the members were aſcending the ſtairs of the banquetting-houſe, a preſs of people crowding with them, the ſtairs broke under them,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:57818:79"/>and Richard, the protectors Son, was much bruiſed, and Mr. Ellis, ſolicitor General, broke his leg.</p>
            <p>Syndercomb, the next Term, was by the direction of the parliament, tryed for this Treaſon at the Kings Bench Bat: He denied the plot, but the evidence ſwearing poſitively againſt him, he was convicted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſtatute of 25 Edw. 3. Juſtice Glyn upon his condemnation declaring, that by the King was under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood any chief magiſtrate of the Nation. He was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried tkence to the Tower, where the Night before his execution, it was ſuppoſed he poyſoned himſelf, as the Coroners Jury gave their Verdict: He went well to bed, deſiring before half an hours privacy for his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, which being clapſed, he opened the door, and rubbing his hands together, and his Noſe with them, he briskly bid them good Night, and being found dead next morning, his body, awhile after, was tyed with his head to the Horſes Tail, and drawn to the ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ffold at Tower-hill, where he was buried, and a ſtake, covered with Iron a top, driven into his body.</p>
            <p>The ſect of the Quakers were now grown nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, among whom one called James Naylor, reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, in his proportions and complexion, the picture of Chriſt, and ſetting his beard and locks in the ſame faſhion, pretended to counterfeit our bleſſed Saviour, and had Dilciples and VVomen miniſtring to him, who blaſphemouſly applied ſeveral expreſſions of ſcripture relating to our Lord Jeſus, to this man. He firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared at Briſtol, where a man leading an Horſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and Dorcas, Erbury, and Martha Symonds, going up to the knees in dirt by his Horſe ſide, ſung aloud, Holy, Holy, Holy, Hoſanna to the higheſt, &amp;c. For this they were ſeized, and brought up to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament: They entred the Houſe ſinging their blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies, and a Committee being appointed to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of their puniſhment, he was ſentenced to be ſet in the Pillory twice, and whipt twice, and his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head to be ſtigmatized with a letter B. for a Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:57818:79"/>and bored through the Tongue with an hot Iron, with which he uſed to anſwer to every queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Thou haſt ſaid it; and the like. He was likewiſe whipt at Briſtol, and thence returned to Bridewell, to be kept cloſe priſoner, and to eat no more than he earned. In Newgate, after his puniſhment, one Mr. Rich, a merchant of credit, that held him by the hand while he was in the Pillory, with divers others, lick'd his wounds; the VVomen were obſerved, ſome to lay their heads in his lap, lying againſt his Feet, others to lean upon his ſhoulder, and as ſoon as any Quaker came into his company, they would firſt take him by the hand, and in a ſtrange note ſay, Holy, Holy, &amp;c. but being removed to Bridewell, after three days wilful faſting, having weakened himſelf even to death, he begged ſome Victuals, and then was ſet to work, which he performed, and came by degrees to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and his underſtanding; after Cromwels death he had his liberty, and ſoon after died.</p>
            <p>
               <q>fore the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector might be deſired to aſſume the ſtile of King, as the moſt known, and moſt agreeable Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</q> This motion was ſeconded by ſeveral of the protectors Courtiers, and April 9. the parliament ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving deſired a meeting with him, came to the Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quetting-houſe at White-Hall, where-the ſpeaker Sir Tho. Widdrington, commended the Title and Office of a King, as being ſettled in this Nation with Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity it ſelf, approved by our Anceſtors, and conſiſtent with our Laws and the temper of the people, and then preſented him the model of their humble peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and advice to that purpoſe: His Highneſs, in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer <pb n="154" facs="tcp:57818:80"/>hereto, ſaid, <q>Mr. Speaker, this is a weighty matter, and therefore I deſire ſpace to ſeek God, the charge that you would lay upon me being too heavy for me to bear without his aſſiſtance, for the ENgliſh are the beſt people in the World, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire all tenderneſs and conſideration whatſoever, to be uſed for preſerving their liberties and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The next day a Committee was appointed to wait upon him, and receive his ſcruples, and to offer rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for his ſatisfaction. The objections the protector made, were, Firſt, <q>That the Title of a King is a Name of Office, and any Name that may imply the ſupream magiſtrate hath the ſame ſignification, and therefore there is no neceſſity of a change.</q> To this they reply, <q>That the Name of a King is only equal to, and comprehenſive of the Office of the ſupream magiſtrate: It is a rule, That the King; of England cannot alter the Laws by reaſon of their Name, and that there is no obligation upon any other, that the very Title was declared neceſſary in the 9th. of Edw. 4. in the controverſie betwixt him and Hen. 7. and every action done by the King in poſſeſſion was valid, and that the Name King had beginning with our Laws, and that new Laws muſt be made for ſettling the Government in a protector.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The other objection was the danger and difficulty of altering the ſame Government to a Common-wealth, and the refuſal of ſome Judges, and acting of others, upon that ground: That another parliament might change thoſe reſolutions: The diſlike of the good peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and Army; that providence had laid aſide the Title of King after ſeven years War, and many of the chief of thoſe who were Inſtrumental therein were diſſatisfied. Theſe ſcruples the Committee endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to remove, by alledging, <q>That providence had now brought about affairs ſo, that it ſeemed neceſſary for His Highneſs to comply with it; and
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:57818:80"/>as for diſcontented perſons, they have been always found in the beſt of Governments.</q> But becauſe this was a matter of conſequence, I ſhall repeat the ſpeech made by the Lord Whitlock, one of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee, ſent to the protector, with his anſwer thereto; who after ſeveral others had offered their ſentiments, ſummed up the moſt material reaſons as followeth:</p>
            <q>
               <p>Sir, I have but very little to trouble your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with, ſo much hath been already ſpoken and ſo well, that it will be hard for me, or any other, to undertake to add to it, only the duty of my Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſomething due to your Highneſs, occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons me to ſpeak a few words, to acknowledge, with very humble thanks, the Honour and Right which you have done this Committee, by the clear and free diſcourſes and conferences which they have had with your Highneſs, and for your frequent expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and teſtimonies of affection and reſpect to the parliament, whoſe-ſenſe in this, I may preſume to ſpeak, That never any perſons met their ſupream magiſtrate with more love, duty and honour, than the parliament have met your Highneſs with in their addreſſes; which argument of love, deſerves that eſteem and force which I doubt not but your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs will put upon it. I am fearful to be too tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous at any time, eſpecially at ſo late an hour, and therefore ſhall ſpeak but ſhort to ſome things which I remember not to have been mentioned: Your Highneſs was pleaſed at the laſt meeting to ſay, That the original Inſtitution of the Title, King, was by common conſent, and that the ſame common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent might inſtitute any other Title, and make it as effectual as that of King: This muſt be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, but withal, you may be pleaſed to obſerve, That the Title of King is not only by an original common conſent, but that conſent alſo approved and confirmed, and the Law fitted thereunto, and that fitted to the Laws, by the experience and induſtry
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:57818:81"/>of many Ages, and many hundreds of years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whereas any other Title will be only by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent common conſent, without that experience and approbation: For that experience which your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs mentioned to have been of other Titles, and the due adminiſtration of Juſtice under them, this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience is far ſhort of the other; and for the courſe of Juſtice, we have cauſe to thank that care which placed ſo good Judges and Officers over us. Yet give me leave to ſay, That in private cauſes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween party and party, and in publick matters in nominal cauſes, it was not eaſie to find Juſtice to be done by ſome Jurors, and many queſtions have riſen upon the occaſion of thoſe new Titles: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning that tender point of good mens ſatisfaction, I think it requires a very great regard from us, and I doubt not but thoſe good people will be fully ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, if they conſider the covenants, promiſes and precepts, which in the ſcripture are annex'd to the Name of King; and although ſome have alledged, that they belong to any chief magiſtrate, as well as to King, yet no man did ever read the original word tranſlated otherwiſe than King: Neither do I find the Title of Protector once mentioned in the holy Text. If the preſent Authority be a lawful Authority, which I hope none of us will deny, ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thoſe good men who are ſo well principled in Godlineſs, will not forget that precept of ſubmiſſion to Authority, and to be ſatisfied with that which lawful Authority ſhall ordain; their Rights and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties are the ſame with ours, and the parliament cannot adviſe any thing for the preſervation of the peoples Rights, but theſe good men are included, which I hope will be no diſſatisfaction to them. In all the changes which we have ſeen, there hath been a diſſatisfaction to ſome, yet ſtill the bleſſing of God hath gone a long through all theſe changes, with thoſe who carried on his Intereſt; and the cauſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:57818:81"/>the ſame, the ſame mercies have been continued. And I doubt not, but if the intended change and reſtitution be made, as I hope it will, I doubt not but the ſame God will continue his bleſſings to that Good Old Cauſe wherein we are ingaged, and that good men will receive ſatisfaction by it. Your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs hath been told, That the Title of King is upon the foundation of Law, and that a new Title muſt have a conſtitution to make the Laws relate unto it, and that unto the Laws; I ſhall only add this, That a Title by Relation is not ſo certain and ſale as a Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle upon the old foundation of the Law, and that a Title upon a ſingle preſent conſtitution, as any new Title muſt be, cannot be ſo firm as a Title built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the preſent conſtitution, and upon the old foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Law likewiſe, which the Title of King will be. If any inconvenience ſhould enſue upon your acceptance of this Title which the parliament adviſeth, your Highneſs's ſatisfaction will be that they did adviſe it.</p>
               <p>On the contrary part, if any inconvenience ſhould ariſe upon your Highneſs refuſal of this Title which the parliament hath adviſed, your burthen will be the greater, and therefore whatſoever may fall out, will be better anſwered by your Highneſs comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with your parliament then otherwiſe; the Queſtion is not altogether new, ſome inſtances have been given of the like, to which I ſhall add two or three. The Title of the Kings of England, in the Realm of Ireland, was, Lord of Ireland; and the parliament in the 33 year of Hen. 8. relating, That inconveniences did ariſe there, by reaſon of that Title, did enact, That Hen. 8. ſhould aſſume the Stile and Title of King of Ireland, which in the judgment of the parliament was preferred before the other.</p>
               <p>In the State of Rome new Titles proved fatal to their Liberties; their caſe was not much unlike
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:57818:82"/>ours, they were wearied with a Civil War, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to a ſettlement, ſome would not admit the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of Rex to be uſed, but were contented to give the Titles of Caeſar, Perpetual Dictator, Prince, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, Emperor: So that at length, the will of Caeſar was their Law, who ſaid, I am not a King but Caeſar. The Northern people were more happy among themſelves; a private Gentleman, of a Noble Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, took up Arms with his country-men againſt a Tyrant, and by the bleſſing of God, reſcued the Native Liberties and Rights of their country, from the oppreſſion of that Tyrant: This Gentleman had the Title of Marſhal given unto him, which conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued for ſome years; afterward their Parliament judging it beſt to reſume the old Title, Elected this Gentleman King, and with him was brought in the liberty of Proteſtant Religion, and the eſtabliſhment of the Civil Rights of that people, which have conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in a proſperous condition ever ſince in Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, unto this day. Sir, I ſhall make no other ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication but in my prayers to God, to direct your Highneſs and the Parliament, as I hope he will, to do that which will be moſt for his honour, and the good of his people.</p>
            </q>
            <p>This ſpeech was made April 26. 1657. but the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector finding the inclinations of ſome of the people, and eſpecially of many Officers and Souldiers of the Army, to be very averſe to the Title of King, which they had lately renounced, and likewiſe doubting, as it was then diſcours'd, that they would fortifie his Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, but weaken his Revenue, who required Nineteen hundred thouſand pound a year, for the ſupport of his Government, beſides the charge of the Spaniſh War, he thereupon ſent for the Parliament to the Banquetting-houſe at White-Hall, May 8. following, where he gave them his laſt, and poſitive anſwer to this purpoſe:</p>
            <q>
               <p>Mr. Speaker, I am come hither to anſwer that
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:57818:82"/>which was in your laſt paper to your Committee you ſent me, which was in relation to the deſires which were offered me by the Houſe, in that they called their petition. I confeſs that buſineſs hath put the Parliament to a great deal of trouble, and ſpent much time: I am very ſorry that it hath coſt me ſome, and ſome thoughts, and becauſe I have been the unhappy occaſion of the expence of ſo much time, I ſhall ſpend little of ſt now: I have, the beſt I can, reſolved the whole buſineſs in my thoughts, and I have ſaid ſo much already in teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the whole, that I think I ſhall not need to repeat any thing that I have ſaid. I think it is a Government, that the aims of it ſeek much a ſettling of the Nation on a good foot, in relation to Civil Rights and Liberties, which are the Rights of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and I hope I ſhall never be found to be of them that ſhall go about to rob the Nation of theſe Rights, but to ſerve them what I can to the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them: It hath alſo exceeding well provided for the ſafety and ſecurity of honeſt men, in that great, natural, and religious liberty, which is Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Conſcience. Theſe are great fundamentals, and I muſt bear my Teſtimony to them (as I have, and ſhall do ſtill, ſo long as God lets me live in this World) that the intentions of the things are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry honourable and honeſt, and the product worthy of a Parliament; I have only had the unhappineſs, both in my conferences with your Committees, and in the beſt thoughts I could take to my ſelf, not to be convicted of the neceſſity of that thing that hath been ſo often inſiſted upon by you, to wit, The Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of King, as in it ſelf neceſſary, as it ſeems to be apprehended by your ſelves; and I do with all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and reſpect, to the judgment of the Parliament, teſtifie that (ceteris paribus) no private judgment is to lye in the ballance with the judgment of a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, but in things that reſpect particular perſons,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:57818:83"/>every man that is to give an account to God of his actions, he muſt in ſome meaſure be able to prove his own work, that is, To have an approbation in his own conſcience of that he is to do or forbear: And whilſt you are granting others liberties, ſurely you will not deny me this, it being not only a liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty but a duty (and ſuch a duty as I cannot without ſinning forbear) to examine my own heart and thoughts, and judgment, in every work which I am to ſet my hand to, or to appear in for.</p>
               <p>I muſt confeſs therefore, that though I do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge all the other, yet I muſt be a little confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in this, that what with the circumſtances that accompany humane actions, whether they be cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of time or perſons, whether circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that relate to the whole, or private or particular circumſtances that compaſs any perſon that is to render an account of his own actions, I have truly thought, and do ſtill think, that if I ſhould (at the beſt) do any thing on this account to anſwer your expectation, it would be at the beſt doubtingly, and certainly what is ſo, is not of faith; whatſoever is not of faith is ſin to him that doth it, whether it be with relation to the ſubſtance of the action, about which the conſideration is converſant, or whether to circumſtances about it, which make all indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent actions good or evil to him that doth it. I ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under this conſideration, think it my duty, only I could have wiſhed I had done it ſooner for your ſake, for ſaving time and trouble, and indeed for the Committees ſake, to whom I muſt acknowledge publickly, I have been unſeaſonably troubleſome; I ſay, I could have wiſhed I had given it ſooner, but truly this is my anſwer, That although I think the Government doth conſiſt in very excellent parts in all, but in that one thing the Title, as to me: I ſhould not be an honeſt man if I ſhould not tell you that I cannot accept of the Government, nor under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:57818:83"/>the trouble and charge of it, which I have a little more experimented than every man, as to what troubles and difficulties do befal men in ſuch Truſts, and in ſuch Undertakings: I ſay, I am perſwaded to return this anſwer to you, That I cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take this Government with the Title of a King, and this is mine anſwer to this great and weighty buſineſs.</p>
            </q>
            <p>The Protector having refuſed the Title of King, the Committee of Settlement was ordered to prepare an Explanatory Act to the humble petition and advice, in reſpect of the Protectors Oath, his Councils, the Members of Parliament; the other Houſe, which was to conſiſt of about ſixty Lords of the Protectors Elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and having Voted, That Protector ſhould be the Title of the chief Magiſtrate, and the Petition and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice being allowed accordingly, the Houſe deſired a conference with His Highneſs, who accordingly meets them, May 25. 1657. in the painted Chamber, where Sir Tho. Widdrington preſents him with the humble Petition and Advice, the ſubſtance whereof was,</p>
            <q>
               <p>1. That His Highneſs Oliver Cromwel, under the Title of Lord Protector, would be pleaſed to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the Office of chief Magiſtrate over England, Scotland and Ireland, and the Territories thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to belonging, and to govern according to all things in this Petition and Advice; and alſo, that he would in his life time, appoint the perſon that ſhould ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in the Government after his death. 2. That he would call a Parliament conſiſting of two Houſes, once in three years at fartheſt. 3. That thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who are legally choſen by a free Election of the people to ſerve in parliament, may not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from doing their duties, but by conſent of that Houſe whereof they are Members. 4. That none but thoſe under the Qualifications therein mentioned, ſhall be capable to ſerve as Members in Parliament. 5. That the power of the other Houſe be limited as herein preſcribed. 6. That the Laws
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:57818:84"/>and Statutes of the Land be obſerved and kept, no Laws altered, ſuſpended, abrogated or repealed, or new Laws made but by Act of Parliament. 7. That the yearly ſum of a Million of pounds ſterling be ſettled for the maintenance of the Navy and Army, and three hundred thouſand pounds for ſupport of the Government, beſides other temporary ſupplies as the Commons in Parliament ſhall ſee the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Nation to require. 8. That the number of the Protectors Council ſhall not be above twenty one, whereof the Quorum to be ſeven. 9. The chief Officers of State, as Chancellors, Keepers of the Great Seal, &amp;c. to be appointed by Parliament. 10. That his Highneſs would incourage a godly Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry in theſe Nations, and that ſuch as do revile and diſturb them in the worſhip of God, may be puniſhed according to Law, and where Laws are defective, new ones to be made. 11. That the Proteſtant Chriſtian Religion, as it is contained in the Old and New Teſtament, be aſſerted and held forth for the publick profeſſion of theſe Nations and no other, and that a Confeſſion of Faith be agreed upon, and recommended to the people of theſe Nations, and none be permitted by words or wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, to revile or reproach the ſaid Confeſſion of Faith, &amp;c.</p>
            </q>
            <p>The Petition and Advice being read, was by the Protector paſſed into a Law, though with much ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reluctancy, as the following Speech declared.</p>
            <q>
               <p>Mr. Speaker, I am not come hither this day as to a Triumph, but with the moſt ſerious thoughts that ever I had in my life, being to undertake one of the greateſt burthens that ever was laid upon the back of any humane creature, ſo that without the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the Almighty, I muſt neceſſarily ſink under the weight of it, to the damage and prejudice of theſe Nations: And this being ſo, I muſt ask the help of the Parliament, and the help of all thoſe that
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:57818:84"/>fear God, that by their prayers I may receive aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance from the hand of God, ſeeing nothing but his preſence can enable me to the diſcharge of ſo great a Truſt. And ſeeing this is but an Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction to the carrying on the Government of theſe Nations, and foraſmuch as there are many things which cannot be ſupplied without the help of a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, I think it my duty to deſire your help, not that I doubt of it, for I believe that the ſame ſpirit that led the Parliament to this, will eaſily ſuggeſt the reſt to them, And truly, nothing could have induced me to undertake this intolerable burden to fleſh and blood, had I not ſeen that it was the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments care to anſwer thoſe ends for which they have ingaged; and I call God to witneſs, that I would not have undergone it, had I not ſeen it to be determined by the Parliament to make clearly for the Liberty and Intereſt of the Nation, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of ſuch as fear God, and if theſe Nations be not thankful to you for your care therein, it will fall as a ſin on their heads. To conclude, I would recommend to you the Reformation of the Nation, by diſcountenancing Vice, and giving encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to Good men and Virtue, deſiring that you would not be wanting in any thing that may make for the good of the Nations, wiſhing the Lord to proſper all your aims and endeavours.</p>
            </q>
            <p>This Speech ended, the Members return to their Houſe, and ſoon after the Protector ſends them a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, deſiring their Adjournment till the Inauguration of the Lord Protector could be performed, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly they paſſed a Bill for adjourning from June 26. to Jan. 20. following, June 26. being appointed for his Highneſs ſolemn Inveſtiture; and the ſame day a place being prepared in Weſtminſter-Hall, there were two Chairs ſet, one for the Protector, with a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopy of State over it, and another for the Speaker, with ſeats built Scaffold-wiſe, for the Parliament, on
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:57818:85"/>both ſides, and places below for the Aldermen of London, and others; all which being ready, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector came out of a Room adjoining to the Lords Houſe, and in this order proceeded into the Hall: Firſt went his Gentlemen, then an Herald, the Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney-General, then the Judges, after them Norroy King at Arms, the Lord Commiſſioners of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury, the Seal carried by Commiſſioner Fines, then Garter, and after him the Earl of Warwick with the Sword born before the Protector bare-headed, the L. Mayor Tichburn carrying the City Sword by his left hand: Being ſeated in the Chair, on the left hand ſtood the L. Mayor, and the Dutch Ambaſſador, and on the right the E. of Warwick, and the French Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador, next behind him ſtood his Son Richard, L. Fleetwood, and L. Cleypool, and the Privy-council, upon a lower deſcent ſtood the Lords Montague and Whitlock with drawn Swords.</p>
            <p>Then the Speaker Sir Tho. Widdrington, in the Name of the Parliament, preſented to him ſeveral things that were laid on the Table, which were a Robe of purple Velvet, a Bible, a Scepter, and a Sword, on each of which the Speaker made a ſhort Comment as he delivered them.</p>
            <q>
               <p>1. The Robe of purple: This is an Emblem of Magiſtracy, and imports Righteouſneſs and Juſtice; when you have put on this Veſtment, I may ſay you are a Gown-man. This Robe is of a mixt co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, to ſhew the mixture of Juſtice and Mercy; indeed a Magiſtrate muſt have two hands, Plecten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem &amp; Amplectentem, to Cheriſh and to Puniſh. 2. The Bible is a Book that contains the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, in which you have the happineſs to be well verſed: This Book of Life conſiſts of two Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the Old and New, the firſt ſhews Chriſtum Velatum; the ſecond, Chriſtum Revelatum, Chriſt Veiled and Revealed: It is a Book of Books, and doth contain both Precepts and Examples for good
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:57818:85"/>Government. 3. Here is a Scepter, not unlike a Staff to the weak and poor, it is of ancient uſe in this kind. It's ſaid in Scripture, That the Scepter ſhall not depart from Judah; it was of the like uſe in other Kingdoms, however the Greek Poet calls Kings and Princes Scepter bearers. 4. The laſt thing is a Sword, not a Military but Civil Sword; it is a Sword rather of Defence than Offence, not to defend your ſelf only, but your people alſo. If I might preſume to ſix a Motto upon this Sword, as the Valiant Lord Talbot did upon his, it ſhould be this, Ego ſum Domini Protectoris ad protegendum populum meum, I am the Lord Protectors to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect my people.</p>
            </q>
            <p>After this the Speaker returned again to the Chair, and adminiſtred the Oath to the Protector in theſe following words,</p>
            <q>
               <p>I do in the preſence, and by the Name of Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God, promiſe and ſwear, that to the uttermoſt of my power, I will uphold and maintain the true Reformed Proteſtant Chriſtian Religion in the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity thereof, as it is contained in the Holy Scriptures of the Old and New Teſtament, to the uttermoſt of my power and underſtanding, and incourage the profeſſion and profeſſors of the ſame: And that to the utmoſt of my power, I will endeavour, as chief Magiſtrate of theſe three Nations, the maintenance and preſervation of the peace and ſafety, and Juſt Rights and Priviledges of the people thereof; and ſhall in all things, according to my beſt knowledge and power, govern the people of theſe Nations ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Law.</p>
            </q>
            <p>The Oath adminiſtred, Dr. Manton made a Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and then an Herald ſtood up aloft, giving ſignal to a Trumpet to ſound three times; after which, he did by Authority and Direction of Parliament, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh and proclaim his Highneſs Lord Protector of the Common-wealth of England, Scotland and Ireland,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:57818:86"/>requiring all perſons to yield him due obedience. This Proclamation ended, the Trumpets again ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſome Souldiers and other cryed out, God ſave the Lord Protector: Then was he again proclaimed by an Officer at Arms, ſtanding on the Stairs. The Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies ended, the Protector attended by all the Officers of State, went into the Palace-Yard in his Robes, where entring his Coach, he returned in State to White-Hall.</p>
            <p>This year an Inſurrection was deſigned by thoſe called Fifth Monarchy men, who had divers meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in an Houſe in Shore-Ditch, ſeveral of them being diſcontented perſons, who had been formerly of the Army; they had appointed to have Rendevouzed on Mile-end-Green, and ſo have marched into other Countries to augment their party. At length they were ſeized, and ſome Arms and Ammunition taken with them, and a Standard with a Lyon Couchant, with this Motro, Who ſhall rouſe him up. The Men taken were Venner, a Wine-Cooper, with their Scribe Grey, Goaler Hopkins, Aſhton, and others: About them was ſound a Declaration in print, called, The principle of the Remnant; they were committed to priſon, but after releaſed without proſecution. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe M. Gen. Harriſon, Vice-Admiral Lawſon, Coll. Rich, and Coll. Danvers, were ſecured as Diſcontents. About this time the victorious General Blake return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the Coaſts of Spain, fell ſick of the Scurvy and Dropſie, and dyed juſt entring into Plymouth Sound, where he paſſionately inquired for Land; he was buried with an handſome Funeral from Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich, and interr'd in Hen. 7. Chappel at Weſtminſter.</p>
            <p>The Protector to keep the Spaniards imployed every where, makes a private agreement with France to fend a Brigade of his beſt Infantry, (which the French extreamly wanted, to Flanders) conſiſting of 6000 men, and about May 4. 1657. they arrived in Picardy, and joined with thoſe Forces commanded
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:57818:86"/>by the Marſhal Turein, to which the protector was the more induced becauſe the K. of Spain had invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted K. Charles into his Dominions fince the breach with England, and he was then at Bruges full of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of being reſtored by the power of that King; and the Marqueſs of Ormond, the Lord Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mot, the Lords Gerrard and Wentworth, the Lord Twaf, and General Middleton, had their ſeveral Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments Quartered about the Sea coaſts in order to a Deſcent, and the Dukes of York and Gloceſter had likewiſe commands in Flanders. Sir John Reynolds, one of Cromwels Knights, formerly Commiſſary Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of the Army in Ireland, was General of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Forces, and coll. Morgan Major Gen. Before their embarquement they Rendevouzed at Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Heath, where Mr. Hugh Peters gave them a Sermon for incouragement, and were ſhipped with a months pay in hand, and all new red coats.</p>
            <p>About the middle of September, the French and Engliſh Forces advance into the Spaniſh Territories, and according to agreement ſate down before Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dike, a ſtrong Fortreſs, and put themſelves between it and Dunkirk: General Montague riding before the Splinter with a Fleet of War, it was not long before a continued Battery made the beſieged quit the wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en Fort, which ſo incommoded them when taken by the Engliſh, that they were obliged to yield to mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, Turenne not allowing them better terms becauſe they had refuſed his firſt offers: Mardike was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently put into the hands of the Engliſh according to agreement, in conſideration of our aſſiſtance, and coll. Morgan took poſſeſſion thereof with ſeveral Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments, whom the Spaniards ſoon after endeavoured to remove, by a ſudden and fierce aſſault, after the Armies were drawn into Winter Quarters, ſince be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only two miles from Dunkirk, they were very fearful it might indanger that Town alſo. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, Don John of Auſtria reſolved to hazard a Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lado
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:57818:87"/>and Attack by Night; the Duke of York, and the Marqueſs of Caravene managed the buſineſs, and K. Charles, and the D. of Gloceſter, had conveyed themſelves into Dunkirk to obſerve the ſucceſs of it, Oct. 22. About 4000 Engliſh, Scots, Iriſh, and ſome Spaniards, about Ten a Clock at Night, began the ſtorming of Mardike with Hand-Granadoes, and all other Engines proper for an aſſault, and were got in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Trenches, and had mounted the Scaling Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, but the Engliſh within being ready to receive them, commanded by Reynolds, Morgan, and Lil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingſtone, who were there at that time, the Aſſailants were with great ſlaughter repulſed and beaten down; the Cannon in the mean time, from the Engliſh Fleet in the Splinter, firing their broadſides upon them, being directed by four great Torches ſet up at the four corners of the Fort, how to avoid damaging it. Yet about four a Clock in the morning, the D. of York commanded the aſſault to be renewed, which was done with greater fury, but to as little purpoſe or advantage as before, ſo that day light approaching they were forced to retreat, carrying away the dead in Waggons, which were judged to be ſome hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds, though the number was not certainly known.</p>
            <p>Since force would not prevail, the Duke deſigned to attempt the regaining this important place by ſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagem, to which purpoſe he imployed a Scotch Knight, who was well acquainted with General Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolds, to repreſent to him the advantages he might obtain by ſerving the King, and promoting his Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt and Reſtoration, which it ſeems ſo far prevailed, that Reynolds agreed to give the Duke a meeting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Dunkirk and Mardike, with a party of Horſe on either ſide. At their approach, Reynolds ſhewed much reſpect to the Duke, and ſome private diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes paſſed between them which were never made pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, and then the General returned to the Fort, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="169" facs="tcp:57818:87"/>of this Enterview, diſpatcht away a meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to command General Reynolds inſtantly to Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, which he, with Coll. White, and the Generals Secretary, readily obeying, and taking the firſt ſhip that was ready, and would venture to go off, which was a Dutch Pink of 100 Guns, in a ſtormy Night, Dec. 12 (a Frigate offering to wait upon him the next morning) he was caſt away the ſame Night on the back of the Goodwin-ſands, his Cheſt, Sword, and Belt, being found thereabout, and Coll. Morgan com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in his place.</p>
            <p>About this time there happened Wars between the two Northern Crowns, and the Danes having attack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Bremer-warden, a very ſtrong place, and ſoon after maſter'd it, the Protector ſent Sir Philip Medows Envoy to the K. of Denmark, and Coll. Jephſon to the K. of Sweden, then journying out of Poland, (where he was ingaged in War likewiſe) to meet this new Enemy: They were both well received, and during this Mediation the Protector ſent ſupplies of 2000 men and arms to his Ally the K. of Sweden.</p>
            <p>Mean while the protector at home was ſwearing his Privy Council, perſuant to one of the Arricles of the humble petition and advice, and his Son Richard was made one, and alſo Chancellor of the Univerſity of Oxford: His Son Henry was conſtituted Lord De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty of Ireland; and his Son-in-law, the Lord Fleet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, was deſigned to be Lord Commiſſioner of Scotland, where General Monk at preſent command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

            <p>The time of the prorogation of the parliament be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing expired, they make their appearance again, and the perſons above-named met in the Houſe of Lords, where the protector coming, he ſends to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons to tell them, that he deſired their attendance in the Houſe of Peers, wither the Speaker and the Members go, to whom he makes a very pleaſing ſpeech, concluding, <q>That if they would go on to proſecute what they had begun, they ſhould be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the bleſſed of the Lord, and the Generations to come would bleſs them.</q> After which the Lord Commiſſioner Fiennes ſpake to them, declaring what occaſions the Government had for money, and that the money already granted, though it was thought ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, yet fell much beneath the expence and neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the ſtate; eſpecially that Tax upon the new buildings, falled altogether of what was expected and intended by it, and ſo recommended the whole affair to their conſideration.</p>
            <p>Being ſate in their Houſes, the other Houſe ſent to the Commons, by two of their Members, a meſſage for a day of Humiliation, and were returned with this anſwer, The Houſe will conſider of it; and then, they Voted, that for two months time liberty ſhould be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to exhibit any petitions againſt undue Elections, and conſented to a Faſt, which was kept within the walls of both Houſes, by Dr. Reynolds, Mr. Caryl, Mr. Calamy, and Mr. Griffith.</p>
            <p>The parliament, according to the fourth Article of the Petition and Advice, which ſays, <q>That no Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers legally choſen ſhould be excluded from perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of their duty but by conſent of parliament,</q> immediately proceed to the calling over, and re-ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:57818:89"/>thoſe members which had formerly been ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded by the Protector, to His Highneſs great diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. The Houſe being now full, began to flight the other Houſe, which they ſaid, being a power created by a part of a parliament, ought not to have a Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Voice over a full Houſe, and at length they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to queſtion the protectors power in calling and authorizing them to ſit as an Houſe of Peers. The protector doubting to what height theſe debates might ariſe, Feb. 4. 1657. he goes to the Houſe of Lords, and by the Uſher of the black Rod ſends to acquaint the Commons of his being there; ſo the ſpeaker and members coming to the Bar, His Highneſs ſitting under a Chair of State made a long ſpeech, and in concluſion told them, <q>That it did concern his Intereſt, as much as the publick peace and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity of the Nation, to diſſolve this parliament, and therefore he did now put an end to their ſitting:</q> So the Houſe in obedience to his commands diſſolved. This was the fourth parliament he had diſſolved, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving turned out the Long parliament, the Little par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, the Recognition parliament, and the preſent Juncto. It was ſaid of the three latter, which was ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned by Cromwel himſelf, <q>That the firſt was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led but not choſen: The ſecond did juſt nothing: And the third did nothing Juſt.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Royaliſts now make another attempt for reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring King Charles, of which the protector had Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence by his Emiſſaries, ſo that when the deſign was juſt ripe for execution, he publiſhed a Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for all Cavaliers to depart twenty miles from Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and VVeſtminſter, and the Marqueſs of Ormond, who was perſonally concerned in the Intrigue, with much difficulty eſcaped in a ſmall Boat from Suſſex to Flanders; but ſeveral others were ſeized, as coll.

               </gap>'s General, and Portſmouth, Hull, and other Maritime Fortreſſes, were treated for. The Protector ſent for the Lord Mayor and Aldermen of London, acquainting them with what diſcoveries he had made, and the danger they were in, who thereupon choſe a new Lieutenancy, and changed the Officers of the Trained Bands, and the Protector doubled his Guards, and an alarm was given, that on May 16. the Cavaliers had appointed for their riſing, and firing the Town, and all the Souldiers about the City were to be murdered, whereupon all the ſix Regiments were raiſed at once, and divers Citizens ſeized.</p>
            <p>Soon after another High Court of Juſtice was erected, before whom Dr. Hewit, and Sir Henny Slingsby, were brought and charged with High Treaſon upon theſe Articles: <q>1. That they had traiterouſly and maliciouſly endeavoured to raiſe force, and Ievy War againſt his Highneſs and the Government, and to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert and alter theſame. 2. That they had traiterouſly declared, publiſhed, and promoted, Charles Stuart, eldeſt Son of the late K. Charles, to be King of England, Scotland and Ireland. 3. That they had held Intelligence with the ſaid Charles Stuart.</q> Dr. Hewit would not own the Court, but pleaded ſeveral caſes againſt it, and was therefore condemned as mute: Mr. Mordant was next ſet to the Bar, who argued ſo very plainly and fully againſt the Evidence, that he was acquitted by one voice only. Sir Henry Slingsby de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended himſelf by alledging. That what was ſaid by him about ſeducing the Governor of Hull, and perſwading him to ſurrender that Garriſon to the King, was but only in Jeſt and diſcourſe: He was found guilty and condemned. Mr. Mallory pleaded guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and was ſaved. Mr. Woodcock cleared-himſelf ſo well, that they could faſten nothing upon him. June 8. 1657. Dr. Hewit and Sir Henry Slingsby were Beheaded on Tower-hill, though ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny endeavours were uſed, and much ſollicitation made to ſave their Lives. Some other perſons of inferior quality were likewiſe Tryed and Executed upon this account, as Coll. Edw. Aſhton, who was Hang'd and Quartered at Mark-lane-end, in Tower-ſtreet, Edmund Stacy againſt the Royal-Exchange, and John Bettely in Cheapſide.</p>
            <p>About this time a great Whale of ſixty foot long came up as far as Greenwich, to the admiration of all that ſaw his vaſt bulk, being perſued with Guns, and other weapons, with great danger, and at length was brought dead to the ſhore.</p>
            <p>The French and Engliſh Armies being joined, now ſate down before Dunkirk, reſolving to take it before they ſtirred, which
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:57818:90"/>hotly alarmeſt the Spaniards in all their Quarters; whereupon Don John of Auſtria, conſidering the importance of this place, as being the Key of Flanders, and a Frontier of France, ſo that if the Engliſh poſſeſſed it, they might have an opportunity to conquer all Flanders, by the Forces that might be continually landed from England, with the ſupplies of money which this Town, by their Booties, brought into the Treaſury. Upon theſe and the like motives, he reſolved to attempt its relief, though with the hazard of his whole Army, but whilſt he is getting them together, the Engliſh and French Forces had in a ſhort time run their Trenthes to the Spaniſh Counterſcarp, and ſtill approached nigher the wall, which the Spaniards having notice of, and fearing their relief might come too late, he made all poſſible halfe to its aſſiſtance; the better to effect which, Don John their General dreins moſt of the Garriſors, and compleats a body of ſixteen thouſand men, with which he marches with all ſpeed through Fuernes, and Incamps within a wile and half of Marſhal Tureins Quarters, of which the Confederates having advice, immediately diſlodge with a body of about fifteen thouſand, leaving ſtill enough to Guard the Trenches, and make good the approaches, if the Townſmen ſhould attempt a Sally.

            <p>The Engliſh were commanded by the L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Lockhart, who having firſt ordered a Forlorn Hope of 300 Musketeers to mount the Sand Hills, together with his own Regiment of Foot, under Coll Fenwick, they ſtoutly maintained their ground, though the Spaniards played down continual Volleys of ſhot among them, and the French refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſecond them: He then ſent another conſiderable Brigade to their relief, who inſtantly fell in with the But end of their Muskets among the Spaniſh Foot, and they not being uſed to ſuch Club Law, left the Field and fled; whereupon the French Horſe ſeeing the good fortune of the Engliſh Foot, fell in upon the Spaniſh Horſe, few of whom ſtood the charge, except thoſe under the command of the Dukes of York and Gloceſter, who after ſome reſiſtance, were forced by the number of the aſſailants to follow the reſt.</p>
            <p>In this Battel a great part of the L. Lockharts Regiments were either ſlain or wounded, and Lt. Coll. Fenwick was killed by a Mnsket Bullet. The ſlaughter was great, the French Horſe being very ſevere in the purſuit, ſo that near 3000 were ſlain, and many Spaniſh Noblemen killed, wounded, and taken Priſoners. This to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal rout of the Relievers Army put diſpair into the Dunkirkers, who could now expect no relief either by Sea or Land, the Engliſh Fleet blocking them up by Sea, and Don John of Auſtria not being able
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:57818:90"/>to recruit his Army by Land: Yet the Marqueſs of Leda, their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, to demonſtrate ſome courage, made frequent ſtrong Sallies upon the French Quarters, which ſeemed to proceed rather from Deſpair than Valour, for he who was the life of the buſineſs recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a wound in one of them, of which he ſhortly dyed, and with him the Spaniards loſt poſſeſſion of the Town of Dunkirk, for after the French and Engliſh had played 14 days ſucceſſively with their Mortar-pieces upon the place, the Beſieged grew weary of the ſport, and beat a Parley, and the Town was delivered up to them.</p>
            <p>Dunkirk being eſtabliſhed in the hands of the Engliſh, the French Army, after about a months Siege, poſſeſs themſelves of Graveling, a ſtrong Fortreſs not far from Dunkirk, ſo that the Engliſh and French had now in their hands all the Frontier Towns on this ſide Flanders.</p>
            <p>Amidſt theſe Triumphs and Succeſſes, the Lady Claypool, the Protectors only Daughter, and whoſe image ſhe was ſaid to be, Dyed, Aug. 6. at Hampton-Court, from whence ſhe was conveyed by Water four days after, with a great many Mourning Barges, to Weſtminſter, and there laid in the Painted-Chamber, where a ſtately Hearſe was prepared for her, and about Twelve at Night was carried into K. Henry VII. Chappel, and there Interred in a place purpoſely provided for her. Her death was ſaid to beſo grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous to her Father, that it was thought the cauſe of his own ſoon after, for having been very melancholly from that time, till about the end of Auguſt, his diſtemper at length appeared to be a Tertian Ague, which together with other malignant humours, ſo depreſſed his Vitals, that it brought him to his end, though with many ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings and ſtrugglings, he often falling into Swouns and Trances. He could not be perſwaded at firſt that his Diſtemper was mortal, ſaying, <q>That as God had carried him to that height, he did firmly believe he had ſome further Work for him to do;</q> and ſome of his Chaplains were of the ſame opinion. But his Fits increaſing, and cauſing him to talk delitious, and to faint often, the Privy-Council concluding he could ſcarce endure another Fit, repaired to him, and earneſtly preſſed him, according to the firſt Article of the Petition and Advice, to Nominate his Succeſſor; and though he was hardly ſenſible, yet they demanding if he did not appoint his Eldeſt Son Richard to ſucceed him, he anſwered YES. The Night before his departure, he was obſerved to pray as followeth:</p>
            <p>
               <q>LORD, I am a miſerable Creature, yet I am in Covenant with Thee through Grace, and I may, I will come unto Thee for thy people: Lord, thou haſt made me, though very unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, a mean Inſtrument to do them ſome good, and thee ſervice, and many of them had too high a value for me, though others would be glad of my fall. But Lord, howſoever thou doſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of me, do good to them: Give conſiſtency of Judgment,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:57818:91"/>one heart and mutual love unto them: Let the Name of Chriſt be Glorious throughout the World: Pardon ſuch as delight to trample upon the Aſhes of a Worm, and pardon the folly of this ſhort Prayer, even for Jeſus Chriſt his ſake.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This was on Thurſday Night, and on Friday Morning, Sept. 3. 1658. his twice Victorious day at Dunbar and Worceſter, there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared all the ſigns of a dying perſon, and about Three a Clock in the Afternoon he expired. A day or two before his Death, a very great Tempeſt happened, which was thought to forbode it.</p>
            <p>Thus you have a full account of the end of Oliver Cromwel; Lord Protector of England; Scotland and Ireland, whoſe Valour mounted him to that height by which he raiſed his Family al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt equal to the beſt of the Kingdom, and the Nation to that Glory, that Forreign Princes feared and envied him. He had two Sons, Richard who ſucceeded him, and Henry, who from fixteen years of Age, was by his Father bred a Souldier, and was at his Death Lord Deputy of Ireland: And four Daughters, Bridget firſt Married to the Lord Deputy Ireton, and afterward to the Lord Fleetwood. Elizabeth his ſecond Daughter, Married to the Lord Cleypool, Maſter of his Horſe. Mary his third, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to the Lord Falconbridge. Frances his youngeſt, Married to the Lord Rich, Grandſon to the Earl of Warwick.</p>
            <p>After his expiration, the Corps was Imbalmed, and wrapped in a ſheet of Lead, and Sept. 26. about Ten at Night, removed from White-Hall in a Mourning Hearſe, where his Effigies was with great Magnificence expoſed publickly to the view of multitudes, who came daily to ſee it, till November 3. following, and then in great State it was conducted from Somerſet-Houſe to Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and placed in the Abbey-Church, under a ſtately Monument Erected for it, with the Banners and ſix Enſigns of Honour placed about it, the Corps having been ſome days before Buried in a Vault purpoſely provided for it, in King Henry the Sevenths Chappel.</p>
